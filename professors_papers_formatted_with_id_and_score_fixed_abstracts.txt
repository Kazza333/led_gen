Paper Title
UTI risk factors in older people living with dementia: A conceptual framework and a scoping review.,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"Background and Aims: UTIs greatly impact hospitalization rates for people living with dementia. This study aims to craft a framework through a scoping review, assessing UTI symptoms, risk factors, and non-pharmacological prevention strategies in older people living with dementia. Research Design and Methods: Our scoping review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines, exploring databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science) for topics like geriatric care, urinary tract issues published from January 1977 to April 2023. Two reviewers assessed data, organizing it using the Social-Ecological Model to construct the UTI Prevention (UTIP) framework. Results: The literature review scrutinized 1394 articles, selecting 14 through rigorous evaluation. It detailed demographic characteristics, synthesized UTI symptoms, 14 risk factors, and seven outcomes for older people living with dementia. Moreover, it outlined ten preventive domains and proposed a comprehensive UTI Prevention (UTIP) framework spanning individual, relational, community, and societal levels. This framework aims to prevent UTIs among older people living with dementia, integrating risk factors and outcomes to bolster effective prevention strategies for this population. Discussion and Implications: The review introduced a UTIP framework, and non-pharmacological preventive measures tailored for elderly people living with dementia. However, some factors in the framework require further validation to strengthen their associations with outcomes. Preventive measures from studies had limitations like small sample sizes, bias risks, and inconsistent findings. Future research should prioritize robust randomized trials with strong statistical power, strict criteria, and consistent individual-level interventions to boost outcome reliability and validity. Such efforts will enhance the credibility of findings and contribute significantly to refining preventive strategies for this vulnerable population.","

Paper Title
Evaluating Cognitive Impairment in a Large Health Care System: The Cognition in Primary Care Program,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Background: The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is rising. Primary care providers (PCPs) will increasingly be required to play a role in its detection but lack the training to do so. Objective: To develop a model for cognitive evaluation which is feasible in primary care and evaluate its implementation in a large health system. Methods: The Cognition in Primary Care Program consists of web-based training together with integrated tools built into the electronic record. We implemented the program among PCPs at 14 clinics in a large health system. We (1) surveyed PCPs to assess the impact of training on their confidence to evaluate cognition, (2) measured the number of cognitive assessments they performed, and (3) tracked the number of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Results: Thirty-nine PCPs completed the training which covered how to evaluate cognition. Survey response rate from those PCPs was 74%. Six months after the end of the training, they reported confidence in assessing cognition (mean 4.6 on 5-point scale). Cognitive assessments documented in the health record increased from 0.8 per month before the training to 2.5 in the six months after the training. Patients who were newly diagnosed with MCI increased from 4.2 per month before the training to 6.0 per month in the six months after the training. Conclusions: This model for cognitive evaluation in a large health system was shown to increase cognitive testing and increase diagnoses of MCI. Such improvements are essential for the timely detection of ADRD."

Implementation and impact of a Dementia Friends pilot,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Introduction Dementia Friends is a dementia awareness program that trains lay leaders (called “dementia champions”) to give presentations about dementia to combat stigma in their community. Objective In this mixed methods study, we aimed to evaluate the impact and implementation of a pilot Dementia Friends program in Washington State to assess whether it improved attitudes towards people living with dementia. Method Fifteen champions were recruited, who organized 22 Dementia Friends sessions, reaching 214 Dementia Friends participants. We collected data through interviews with champions and surveys administered to Dementia Friends participants before, immediately after, and 1-month after attending a Dementia Friends session. The survey collected demographic information and measured respondent attitudes towards people living with dementia using the Dementia Attitudes Scale. Results Quantitative analysis showed that Dementia Attitude scores improved after a Dementia Friends session; this improvement was maintained through the 1-month follow-up. In qualitative analysis of champion interviews, we identified several suggestions regarding implementation of the Dementia Friends program, which could strengthen the program and better support champions in their role, such as increasing logistical assistance during participant recruitment. Conclusion Dementia Friends sessions were effective in improving participant attitudes towards people living with dementia and inspiring ongoing action towards building Dementia-Friendly communities. Champions found deep meaning in their role, but would benefit from increased support to make the volunteer role more sustainable. Our findings can inform efforts to successfully deliver Dementia Friends in other locations.","

EPIDEMIOLOGIC PATTERNS OF POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION USE IN OLDER ADULT DRIVERS,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Abstract Use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) by older adult drivers has been linked to increased crash risk. The objective of this study was to examine the epidemiologic patterns of PIM use in a cohort of 2990 drivers aged 65-79 years at the time enrollment (July 2015 to March 2017). We applied the 2023 Beers Criteria to identify PIMs from medication data collected through the “brown-bag review” method at baseline, year 2 and year 4 of follow-up for older adults participating in the Longitudinal Research on Aging Drivers project. We assessed time trends in the prevalence of PIM use and the composition of PIMs using the chi-square tests. The prevalence of PIM use was 16.2% at baseline, which decreased slightly in year 2 (14.0%) and year 4 (13.2%). The three most frequently used PIMs were nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics, antidepressants, and estrogens, accounting for 19.4%, 17.8% and 14.1% of all PIMs, respectively. Of PIM users, 12.7% were using ≥2 PIMs at baseline, 12.5% in year 2, and 10.0% in year 4. PIM use among older adult drivers is fairly common. Epidemiologic patterns of PIM use among older adult drivers have remained stable during the four years of follow-up."

THE COGNITION IN PRIMARY CARE PROGRAM: A STEP-BY-STEP CLINIC WORKFLOW PUTTING THE GSA KAER TOOLKIT INTO ACTION,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Abstract In 2020 University of Washington (UW) Medicine began developing Cognition in Primary Care (CPC), a quality improvement program adapting the GSA KAER Toolkit to help primary care providers (PCPs) detect patients with cognitive impairment in their 16-clinic primary care network. The CPC consists of a 3-part training program to help PCPs diagnose, manage and counsel patients; a set of tools embedded into the electronic health record to facilitate cognitive evaluation; and an in-clinic workflow providing on-site support for providers within their own clinic setting. During this process we interviewed providers and developed a hybrid remote and in-person orientation for clinics to initiate a workflow to support improved cognitive evaluations. Utilizing pre-implementation input, the CPC in-clinic workflow was pilot-tested at two UW primary care clinics in 2021/2022. This presentation will describe content of the clinic orientation and implementation of CPC to include 1) the typical timeframe and content of orientation; 2) meetings with clinic leadership; 3) overview of provider/staff meetings; 4) in-person walk-through for placement of materials; 5) invitation to training; 6) a 12-page handbook outlining steps in the workflow; 7) other printed CPC materials, e.g., dementia warning signs, MoCA and AD8 forms, Alzheimer Association referral cards; and 8) follow-up focus group feedback. Evaluation of the pilot clinics following implementation found significant use of all tools by PCPs and an increase in diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment. This clinic workflow may be useful as a model for other health care systems to initiate cognitive evaluation programs in primary care."

Paper Title
Electronic Health Record Tools to Facilitate Diagnosis of Cognitive Impairment in Primary Care,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"With novel biomarkers and treatments for dementia on the horizon, the need to detect cognitive impairment at early stages is urgent. The role of primary care providers (PCPs) in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is essential in meeting this need. Cognition in Primary Care (CPC) is a quality improvement program developed at the University of Washington (UW), Seattle, which includes a three‐part Continuing Medical Education (CME), clinical workflow, and electronic health record toolset to support PCPs in early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. This program was developed using input from UW providers in primary care practice and elements from the KAER (Kickstart, Assess, Evaluate, Refer) Toolkit developed by the Gerontological Society of America (GSA). Our pragmatic approach involved the development of tools integrated into Epic, the electronic health record system in place at UW, that can be used during a patient visit to guide PCPs through the process of evaluating cognitive function. The toolset includes 1) a list of signs that may trigger the need for a dedicated follow‐up visit to evaluate cognition; 2) a cognitive checklist for related conditions affecting cognition (e.g., potentially harmful medications, depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and obstructive sleep apnea); 3) a structured framework for cognitive evaluation including validated instruments (e.g., MoCA and AD8); 4) referrals to specialty care; 5) billing guidelines; and 6) community resources and materials that patients and care partners can use both pre‐ and post‐diagnosis. We have pilot‐tested these tools in UW primary care clinics and found high utilization both within and outside of targeted clinics indicating a halo effect of usage beyond those who attended the CME training. In this presentation, we will provide detailed descriptions of these Epic tools focusing on clinical application to total patient care. We plan to publish these workflow tools onto the Epic Digital Library to be downloaded and used by other health systems. Future plans include producing on‐demand CME training modules, a post‐diagnosis checklist, and applications for use of these tools in systems outside of Epic."

Developing a cognitive assessment toolkit for primary care: qualitative assessment of providers’ needs and perceptions of usability in clinical practice,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Burden of dementia is expected to substantially increase. Early dementia is underdiagnosed in primary care. Given the benefits of active management of dementia, earlier detection in primary care is imperative. The aim of this study was to understand primary care provider (PCP) perceptions of implementing a cognitive assessment toolkit in primary care. Methods PCPs in a large health system in the US were recruited to a qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews. Interviews captured provider perceptions of options for implementing a cognitive assessment toolkit derived from the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) KAER (Kickstart, Assess, Evaluate, Refer) toolkit, including a workflow and adapted clinical tools. A content analysis approach distinguished themes and exemplary quotes. Results Ten PCPs were interviewed. They found the toolkit useful, felt the term Kickstart was not specific to dementia care, and stressed that addressing cognitive evaluation would need to be easy to implement in a clinical workflow. Finally, providers knew many resources for referral but were unsure how to help patients navigate options. Conclusions Providers stressed simplicity, ease, and efficiency for implementation of a cognitive assessment toolkit. Incorporating these findings into the development of clinical tools and workflows may increase cognitive evaluations conducted by PCPs."

Perceptions and Beliefs of Memory Loss and Dementia Among Korean, Samoan, Cambodian, and Chinese Older Adults: A Cross-Cultural Qualitative Study.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Older adults who are Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) represent one of the fastest growing populations in the United States and face a significant burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Little is known about ADRD among AAPI subgroups. The current study aimed to: (a) explore perceptions and beliefs of memory loss and dementia among Korean, Samoan, Cambodian, and Chinese older adults in the United States; and (b) identify culturally relevant facilitators and barriers of participation in a brain health program among four AAPI subgroups. Seven focus groups comprising 14 Cambodian, 21 Chinese, 14 Korean, and 13 Samoan older adults were conducted. Data were analyzed using inductive and indigenous coding approaches. Similar and unique perceptions and experiences related to memory loss were identified. Future research could include developing and testing culturally tailored and language congruent strategies regarding ADRD education and resources to facilitate ADRD early detection among AAPI older adults.

EVALUATION OF COGNITION IN PRIMARY CARE (CPC): A PILOT STUDY TO INCREASE EARLY DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DEMENTIA,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Abstract Despite evidence that early detection of mild cognitive impairment and dementia leads to improved patient care, these conditions remain under-diagnosed in primary care. To address this gap at University of Washington Medicine, we have developed and pilot-tested a program to increase cognitive evaluations and improve dementia care by primary care providers (PCPs). The Cognition in Primary Care (CPC) program was designed utilizing stakeholder-selected components of the GSA KAER (Kickstart-Assess-Evaluate and Refer) Model and Toolkit (2020 Edition), developed by the Gerontological Society of America (GSA). In this presentation we will describe evaluation of the CPC Program including (a) education training; (b) use of assessment tools integrated within the electronic health record (e.g. potentially harmful medications, depressive symptoms, alcohol use, sleep apnea, etc.); (c) practice recommendations such as dedicated evaluation appointments, diagnoses and referrals, and (d) PCP use of community resources for post-diagnosis support. A total of 66 PCPs participated in the series of 3 CME educational seminars. Over 93% of participants reported the content to be highly relevant and expected to incorporate it into their practice; commitments to use specific tools were made. Analysis is underway to determine impact of the program by comparing the above metrics before and after the training as well as between trained and untrained PCPs. Results from this evaluation will inform modifications to increase utilization of the CPC Model within UW Medicine, will be used to package the program to share with other primary care systems, and will guide future enhancements to the GSA KAER Toolkit.","

Paper Title
A Typical Week with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Identifying the experience of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may help develop research agendas, interventions, and other supports to better match individuals' needs. The purpose of this study was to explore the subjective experience of a "typical week" living with MCI to document (1) important activities, (2) barriers to usual activities, and (3) facilitators and supports.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted remote individual photo-elicitation interviews with 11 community-dwelling adults aged 55 years or older with MCI. Participants each provided 5-10 photographs of daily life taken over one week to facilitate a semi-structured qualitative interview. Interview transcriptions were coded in Dedoose software and analyzed using thematic analysis.


RESULTS
Participants shared photos and narratives highlighting the important activities in a typical week, in which physical activity, social engagement, spiritual and religious practice, hobbies, and cognitive stimulation were central. Many also shared disruptions to former routines and reduction of activities alongside increased use of new strategies and environmental supports (e.g., calendars, smartphones). Finally, emergent themes centered on disclosure of their diagnosis and reflections about the future.


DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Participant-generated images aided data collection and facilitated discussion of sensitive topics with individuals with MCI. Such narratives may illustrate the needs and opportunities to promote well-being in individuals with MCI, including engagement in meaningful and health-promoting activities, assessing barriers to important daily activities, and considering supports that match the experience and needs of those with MCI.","

Abstract
"Abstract A KAER Model recommendation is to refer individuals diagnosed with dementia to resources that help them prepare for the future and services that provide ongoing support. The purpose of this project was to locate local quality services and develop a resource directory for persons with cognitive impairment for use by providers, staff, individuals, families, and caregivers. We worked with a Community Advisory Board and interviewed individuals and caregivers to understand what resources are useful and important to include in the resource directory. We built a web-based resource directory that allows users to query resources based on specific needs. We integrated the resource directory within the electronic health record for providers to include after visit summaries. A resource directory was deployed for community use, with goals of sustainability and longevity after this project is completed."

Abstract
"Bearing witness in oncology nursing is a critical practice for supporting patients with cancer, and yet it is an understudied phenomenon most described at the end of life. A literature review was performed to better understand the importance of bearing witness across the cancer care trajectory and to elucidate how the practicing oncology nurse can operationalize this skill in the clinical setting. Studies suggest that oncology nurses who successfully bear witness in their practice not only assist patients and families in meaning-finding, but also sustain themselves for the difficult work of oncology through the deeply gratifying gift they receive from the experience."

A Systems-Wide Approach for Early Detection and Management of Dementia in Primary Care,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Abstract Dementia is frequently unrecognized and under-reported by health care providers. The needs of an aging population increase the burden on an already over-worked primary care system that is often without the appropriate training, resources, and reimbursement to address the growing number of people with cognitive decline in the US. In this symposium we present a systems-wide approach within University of Washington (UW) Primary Care to increase awareness of early signs and symptoms, detection of cognitive impairment, and support of providers, patients and caregivers that will ultimately improve outcomes of care. This quality improvement (QI) program integrates stakeholder-selected components of the GSA KAER (Kickstart-Assess-Evaluate and Refer) Model and Toolkit (2020 Edition), developed by the Gerontological Society of America (GSA), into primary care practice. We describe content and logistics of a continuing education intervention for primary care providers and clinical staff to increase skills for evaluation and management of dementia. Working with UW clinic managers and information technology (IT), we have developed a pragmatic system for streamlining operations and documenting care utilizing newly developed interdisciplinary workflows and electronic health record order sets. Using input from our Community Advisory Board, we explain development of a web-based resource directory to be used in-clinic and at home to support providers, staff, patients, families, and caregivers across cognitive changes. Strategies presented here are aimed to help other health care systems initiate steps to integrate KAER and other tools into a practical QI program for improving detection and management of dementia through support of primary care.","

Frailty measurements in hospitalised orthopaedic populations age 65 and older: A scoping review,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Abstract Aims and Objectives To identify and compare frailty instruments used with hospitalised orthopaedic patients aged over 65. Background Frailty predicts clinical events in orthopaedic patients aged over 65. However, the strengths and limitations of different approaches to measuring frailty in this population are rarely discussed. As such, a comprehensive review to address the gap is needed. Design Scoping review using Arksey and O’Malley framework. Methods PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies published from 2006 to 2020 regarding frailty instruments in older orthopaedic patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses were followed. Results The initial search resulted in 1,471 articles. After review against inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final set of 31 articles containing 15 unique frailty instruments were evaluated. Most of the articles were from Western countries. Fried's phenotype and Frailty Index were commonly used. The frailty index was mostly modified to measure frailty. In hip fracture, physical function items were frequently modified in the measurement of frailty. Trained physicians and nurses administered most frailty instruments. Frailty screening was commonly conducted at hospital admission and used to prognosticate both postoperative complications and hospital outcomes. Most instruments could be completed within 10 min. Reported psychometrics had acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusion Many reliable frailty measures have been used in the inpatient orthopaedic settings; however, evidence is still lacking for a gold standard frailty instrument. More research is needed to identify the best‐performing measure. Frailty evaluation in patients with physical limitations is challenging with existing instruments. Clinical context, resources required and instrument quality are essential factors in selecting a frailty instrument. Relevance to clinical practice Musculoskeletal symptoms in older patients may bias frailty assessment. Proactive frailty screening with valid and practical instruments is vital to strengthen preoperative risk stratification and improve post‐surgical outcomes."

Dementia Care Coaching: A Pilot to Evaluate Acceptability and Feasibility in Care Communities,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Abstract The Alzheimer’s Association (AA) Dementia Care Practice Recommendations (DCPR) outline ten recommendations to achieve quality care with a person-centered focus. The AA has developed tools to assist care communities (CC) to evaluate their status within the recommendations by working with a trained coach to maximize adoption and implementation of these recommendations. The purpose of this pilot was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of pairing trained DCPR coaches with CC teams to implement the DCPR tools. Seven CCs were recruited and four received the DCPR overview and self-assessment. Of the four CC, one withdrew and did not receive the intervention. The remaining three were located in a suburban area, nonprofit, and with memory care units. Data was collected from November 2019 through March 2020. Nine CC staff participated with a mean age 35.8 years and had worked for 11.8 years. Baseline mean scores on the Organizational Readiness to Implementing Change (ORIC) scale were 4.6 for the commitment domain and 4.4 for the efficacy domain. Mean scores on the Nursing Home Employee Satisfaction Survey were high. Sixty-nine percent of CC participants were satisfied with their jobs (greater than 4). Findings from mid-project interviews with the coaches revealed difficulty with scheduling appointments, significant efforts needed to get the “right” people at the table and need for the DCPR tools to be more user-friendly. No post-intervention results were collected due to closing of the CCs to visitors due to COVID. The DCPR tools shows promise and are being evaluated in additional CCs.","

Abstract
"Abstract We implemented the KAER toolkit in the University of Washington primary care clinics. In this session we share the workflows implemented to promote the KAER model and share the tools we developed within EPIC, the system's electronic medical record (EMR). We collaborated with clinic staff to develop interdisciplinary workflows including: training patient service representatives, social workers, nurses, and medical assistants (MAs) about 'red flags;' training medical assistants to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and assuring they are appropriately entered into flowsheets in EPIC. We created a checklist (EPIC 'SmartPhrase') and educated the clinics' interdisciplinary teams to utilize it within their scope of practice. Additionally, we created an order set (EPIC 'SmartSet') of commonly ordered tests and referrals to expedite evaluation of patients with suspected cognitive impairment. Lastly, we created a direct link from our EMR to our website containing community resources."

Exploring the impact of workforce turnover on the sustainability of evidence-based programs: A scoping review,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Background Evidence-based programs (EBPs) are used across disciplines to integrate research into practice and improve outcomes at the individual and/or community level. Despite widespread development and implementation of EBPs, many programs are not sustained beyond the initial implementation period due to many factors, including workforce turnover. This scoping review summarizes research on the impact of workforce turnover on the sustainability of EBPs and recommendations for mitigating these impacts. Methods We searched 10 databases for articles that focused on an EBP and described an association between workforce turnover and the sustainment or sustainability of the program. We created a data abstraction tool to extract relevant information from each article and applied the data abstraction tool to all included articles to create the dataset. Data were mapped and analyzed using the program sustainability framework (PSF). Results and Discussion A total of 30 articles were included in this scoping review and mapped to the PSF. Twenty-nine articles described impacts of workforce turnover and 18 articles proposed recommendations to address the impacts. The most frequent impacts of workforce turnover included increased need for training, loss of organizational knowledge, lack of EBP fidelity, and financial stress. Recommendations to address the impact of workforce turnover included affordable and alternative training modalities, the use of champions or volunteers, increasing program alignment with organizational goals, and generating diverse funding portfolios. Conclusion The sustainment of EBPs is critical to ensure and maintain the short- and long-term benefits of the EBP for all participants and communities. Understanding the impacts of workforce turnover, a determinant of sustainability, can create awareness among EBP-implementing organizations and allow for proactive planning to increase the likelihood of program sustainability."

Abstract
"ABSTRACT Dementia is a growing public health concern, and African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately affected compared to White Americans. Improving cognitive health outcomes and reducing disparities requires a diverse, interdisciplinary workforce. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Healthy Brain Research Network (HBRN) Scholars Program trained racially/ethnically and gender-diverse scholars through mentored, collaborative research. Entry, exit, and alumni surveys and a Scholar Spotlight Series queried motivation, goals, acquired skills, accomplishments, program impact, and scholar perspectives. Scholars (n = 41) were majority female (n = 31, 75.6%), graduate students (n = 23, 56.1%), and racially/ethnically diverse (n = 20, 48.7%). Scholars primarily represented Medicine (n = 19, 46.3%) and Public Health (n = 12, 29.3%). Exiting scholars (n = 25) secured faculty/professional positions (n = 9, 36.0%), awards/funding (n = 12, 48.0%), and publications (n = 8, 32.0%). Alumni (n = 10) secured cognitive health-related positions/fellowships (n = 7, 70.0%). The HBRN Scholars Program is an adaptable model for other thematic networks to prepare scholars in collaborative skills critical for effective research and practice."

Terms and Measures of Cognitive Health Associated With Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease: A Scoping Review,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"The Healthy Brain Initiative: National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health (2007) called on the research community to disseminate its work on cognitive aging and cognitive health. The purpose of this scoping review was to (1) identify terminology that cognitive, social, and behavioral scientists use to describe cognitive aging and cognitive health, in association with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, among older adults; (2) demonstrate how such terms are defined; and (3) illustrate how these constructs are measured in research settings. Empirical studies published 2007–2018 were examined for terminology, definitions, disciplinary orientation, and measurement mechanisms. Analysis of the corpus and a detailed review of the terms “cognitive impairment” and “mild cognitive impairment” reveal that formal definitions are provided infrequently and measurement of constructs ranges widely. Overall, the variability in terminology, definitions, and measures reflects a need for greater specificity in research communication, such that cross-disciplinary collaboration can be facilitated.","

Advancing Our Understanding of Engaging With Aging.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Our knowledge about healthy aging continues to evolve. To advance the fi eld, new paradigms need to be developed and tested that address the aging experience from the perspective of the person who is aging. Th e American Geriatrics Society challenged professionals to intensify educational, clinical, advocacy, and research eff orts that address healthy aging from a multidimensional perspective (Friedman et al., 2019). More specifi cally, a key area to further develop is person-centered approaches that address older adults’ goals, independence, functioning, resilience, dignity, and life satisfaction. Th e aim of this special issue is to advance our understanding of a process called Engaging With Aging (EWA). EWA is an active, conscious process taken on by an older adult or on behalf of the older adult (Primomo & Belza, 2019). Th is process involves coping with daily living and the aging process, placing an emphasis on active engagement to discover and test adaptations that help individuals maintain independence. Th e notion of EWA was fi rst put forth in a blog written for older adults and later advanced as a framework that can be used to study the processes of EWA. Th e EWA framework describes the nuances of how to engage with the impact of age-related changes, approaches to adapting and managing age-related changes, and challenges encountered. Authors of the articles in this EWA special issue represent varied specialties and roles in gerontology. Each article presents a diff erent perspective on the application of EWA. Carnevali, Primomo, and Belza (2019) describe the EWA framework, a perspective and set of processes older adults may use to manage daily living. Unlike other approaches to aging successfully, EWA was developed from the perspective of a nonagenarian, an insider to the aging process, as well as someone who is a theorist, scholar, and nurse. Carnevali refl ects on her own experience with normal age-related changes, the environment in which the age-related changes occur, the impact they have on function and lifestyle, and cognitive processes that can be used to identify ways to adapt and satisfactorily manage daily living tasks. Th e EWA framework provides a structure to examine the impact of age-related changes as well as older adults’ goals, resources, and adaptive capacities to"

Engaging With Aging: A Framework for Managing Daily Living.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Older adults live with the constant reality of having to manage their daily living with the emergence and progression of normal age-related changes that alter their usual capacities and resource needs. Although literature addresses successful aging, gaps exist in our understanding about how older adults manage daily living tasks, particularly from their viewpoint. To address this, the current authors propose Engaging with Aging (EWA), a perspective and set of processes older adults can use to approach daily living in a reasoned, purposeful manner that has similarities with clinical reasoning. EWA, a person-centered approach, can be considered citizen science in that it was developed by a nonagenarian based on personal experiences. Research using the EWA framework has the potential to advance the science of how older adults can manage and adapt to the impact of age-related changes to maintain independence and life satisfaction, and ultimately contribute to the development of care strategies.

TERMS AND MEASURES OF COGNITIVE AGING AND COGNITIVE HEALTH: A SCOPING REVIEW,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Abstract The Healthy Brain Initiative: National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health (2007) called on the research community to more widely disseminate its work on cognitive aging and cognitive health. However, communication beyond individual disciplines is complex. We identified terminology that social scientists use to describe cognitive aging and cognitive health among older adults, demonstrated how such terms are defined, and illustrated how these constructs are being measured. We searched terms such as Alzheimer* and dementia in studies between 2007 and 2018 (n=209). Geriatrics (n=95), neurology (n=81), psychiatry (n=65), and psychology (n=30) were most common disciplines; however, there was no consistency in how terms were used within and across disciplines. A detailed review of “cognitive impairment” and “mild cognitive impairment” demonstrated that formal definitions were provided infrequently and measurement of constructs ranged widely. The variability in terminology, definitions and measures reflects a need for greater specificity in research communication."

OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT IN EARLY-STAGE MEMORY LOSS INTERVENTIONS: A SCOPING REVIEW,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Abstract Psychosocial and psychoeducational groups are widely recommended for individuals with early stage Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, measurement challenges have hindered researchers’ efforts to demonstrate the efficacy of these groups. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify common measurement tools used in interventions for individuals with early stage ADRD and to develop suggestions for future investigations. CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched; 102 studies were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were set to capture intervention studies that utilized quantifiable measures with participants over age 50. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (73%) employed randomized controlled trial designs. Sample sizes ranged from N=20-236. Most commonly measured outcomes included depression, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and quality of life, but there was little consensus on how to best measure these outcomes. Standardization of psychosocial assessment tools are needed for future intervention studies with early stage ADRD."

Long-Term Adherence and Effectiveness of a Multicomponent Intervention for Community-Dwelling Overweight Thai Older Adults with Knee Osteoarthritis: 1-Year Follow Up.,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Being overweight is a major risk factor for developing knee osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of the current study was to: (a) determine participant adherence to a quadriceps exercise and weight management program after completion of the intervention; and (b) examine whether a quadriceps exercise and weight management program can reduce knee pain and improve knee function and weight loss in 40 community-dwelling overweight Thai older adults with knee OA at 6- and 12-month follow up. Twenty-nine (76.3%) participants completed at least 75% of the program. Two (5%) participants did not complete the program. In the intervention group, significant improvement was noted in knee range of motion at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline, and a significant reduction was noted in knee pain, time spent in the Timed Up and Go test, and body weight compared with baseline. These study variables, except for body weight, between the intervention group and control group were significantly different. This study highlights the benefit of long-term adherence to the multicomponent intervention for community-dwelling overweight Thai older adults with knee OA.

Patterns of Hand Grip Strength and Detection of Strength Loss in Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation: A Feasibility Study.,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES
To determine the feasibility of measuring hand grip strength (HGS) daily in a population of recipients of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), to describe changes in strength measured by HGS, and to describe relationships between laboratory values (hematocrit, hemoglobin, and absolute neutrophil count) and HGS. .


DESIGN
Prospective, longitudinal, repeated measures, within subject. .


SETTING
Inpatient units at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. .


SAMPLE
33 patients admitted in preparation for BMT or for complications from BMT. .


METHODS
HGS measured on admission and daily. .


MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES
HGS, absolute neutrophil count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. .


FINDINGS
Participants found HGS testing to be relatively easy. Average time to complete testing was 7.2 minutes (SD = 1.95). Nineteen experienced 20% or greater decline in HGS during hospitalization, with nine experiencing decline during the conditioning phase. Age, gender, and hemoglobin correlated with HGS. Strength loss was more likely in those undergoing allogeneic compared to autologous BMT. .


CONCLUSIONS
A majority of patients experienced strength decline during BMT, with a subgroup declining during conditioning. A positive relationship existed between HGS and hemoglobin and hematocrit in participants admitted for conditioning for BMT. .


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
Weakness increases risk for falls. Patients may experience as much as 50% strength loss during the course of hospitalization for BMT. Strength loss occurs in the conditioning phase for some patients."

A Scoping Review of Physical Performance Outcome Measures Used in Exercise Interventions for Older Adults With Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Background and Purpose: There is growing evidence that exercise interventions can mitigate functional decline and reduce fall risk in older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Although physical performance outcome measures have been successfully used in older adults without cognitive impairment, additional research is needed regarding their use with individuals who have ADRD, and who may have difficulty following instructions regarding performance of these measures. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify commonly used physical performance outcome measures, for exercise interventions, that are responsive and reliable in older adults with ADRD. Ultimately, we aimed to provide recommendations regarding the use of outcome measures for individuals with ADRD across several domains of physical performance. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to broadly assess physical performance outcome measures used in exercise interventions for older adults with ADRD. Exercise intervention studies that included at least 1 measure of physical performance were included. All physical performance outcome measures were abstracted, coded, and categorized into 5 domains of physical performance: fitness, functional mobility, gait, balance, and strength. Criteria for recommendations were based on (1) the frequency of use, (2) responsiveness, and (3) reliability. Frequency was determined by the number of studies that used the outcome measure per physical performance domain. Responsiveness was assessed via calculated effect size of the outcome measures across studies within physical performance domains. Reliability was evaluated via published studies of psychometric properties. Results and Discussion: A total of 20 physical performance outcome measures were extracted from 48 articles that met study inclusion criteria. The most frequently used outcome measures were the 6-minute walk test, Timed Up and Go, repeated chair stand tests, short-distance gait speed, the Berg Balance Scale, and isometric strength measures. These outcome measures demonstrated a small, medium, or large effect in at least 50% of the exercise intervention studies. Good to excellent reliability was reported in samples of older adults with mild to moderate dementia. Fitness, functional mobility, gait, balance, and strength represent important domains of physical performance for older adults. The 6-minute walk test, Timed Up and Go, repeated chair stand tests, short-distance gait speed, Berg Balance Scale, and isometric strength are recommended as commonly used and reliable physical performance outcome measures for exercise interventions in older adults with mild to moderate ADRD. Further research is needed on optimal measures for individuals with severe ADRD. Conclusions: The results of this review will aid clinicians and researchers in selecting reliable measures to evaluate physical performance outcomes in response to exercise interventions in older adults with ADRD."

Implementation and Maintenance of a Community-Based Older Adult Physical Activity Program.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
We examine facilitators and barriers to the implementation and maintenance of Enhance®Fitness (EF), a group exercise program for older adults, at early-adopter YMCA-affiliated sites, and summarize strategies employed by EF instructors and staff to overcome challenges.


DESIGN AND METHODS
This qualitative study used semi-structured phone interviews with 32 instructors, staff members, and master trainers from 24 different YMCA-affiliated sites. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with a focus on the implementation and maintenance components of the RE-AIM framework.


RESULTS
We identified a series of factors affecting the implementation and maintenance of EF at YMCA-affiliated sites, which can be categorized into program-specific (such as instructor training, the structure of the program, reporting requirements, and insurance coverage), and organizational (such as organizational support and infrastructure for program delivery, champions, and funding to cover the costs of program delivery). Strategies used to overcome challenges associated with these factors include identifying parts of the program that can be adapted, hiring staff and instructors that understand and support the program, and educating staff and instructors about the importance of evidence-based programs and of data collection for program evaluation.


IMPLICATIONS
Assessing the readiness of organizations for program delivery and the match between program goals and the needs of organizations and participants would help facilitate the successful implementation and maintenance of physical activity programs in community settings."

Participant Variation by Delivery Site Type in an Evidence-Based Physical Activity Program.,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"This study examined participant demographic and physical function characteristics from EnhanceFitness, an evidence-based physical activity program for older adults. The sample consisted of 19,964 older adults. Participant data included self-reported health and demographic variables, and results for three physical function tests: chair stand, arm curls, and timed up-and-go. Linear regression models compared physical function test results among eight program site types. Participants were, on average, 72 years old, predominantly female, and reported having one chronic condition. Residential site participants' physical function test results were significantly poorer on chair stand and timed up-and-go measures at baseline, and timed up-and-go at a four-month follow-up compared with the reference group (senior centers) after controlling for demographic variables and site clustering. Evidence-based health-promotion programs offered in community settings should assess demographic, health, and physical function characteristics to best serve participants' specific needs, and offer classes tailored to participant function and ability while maintaining program fidelity."

Paper Title
Methods for Streamlining Intervention Fidelity Checklists: An Example from the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"Maintaining intervention fidelity should be part of any programmatic quality assurance (QA) plan and is often a licensure requirement. However, fidelity checklists designed by original program developers are often lengthy, which makes compliance difficult once programs become widely disseminated in the field. As a case example, we used Stanford’s original Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) fidelity checklist of 157 items to demonstrate heuristic procedures for generating shorter fidelity checklists. Using an expert consensus approach, we sought feedback from active master trainers registered with the Stanford University Patient Education Research Center about which items were most essential to, and also feasible for, assessing fidelity. We conducted three sequential surveys and one expert group-teleconference call. Three versions of the fidelity checklist were created using different statistical and methodological criteria. In a final group-teleconference call with seven national experts, there was unanimous agreement that all three final versions (e.g., a 34-item version, a 20-item version, and a 12-item version) should be made available because the purpose and resources for administering a checklist might vary from one setting to another. This study highlights the methodology used to generate shorter versions of a fidelity checklist, which has potential to inform future QA efforts for this and other evidence-based programs (EBP) for older adults delivered in community settings. With CDSMP and other EBP, it is important to differentiate between program fidelity as mandated by program developers for licensure, and intervention fidelity tools for providing an “at-a-glance” snapshot of the level of compliance to selected program indicators."

The CDC Healthy Aging Research Network: Advancing Science toward Action and Policy for the Evidence-Based Health Promotion Movement,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"Despite recent progress in the uptake of evidence-based health promotion (EBHP) programs within communities, many factors contribute to the need to focus on dissemination. These include the growth in the aging population, health care resource limitations, and interests in preserving community-based opportunities for maintaining independence and maximizing quality of life. For these reasons, The Prevention Research Centers’ Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN), funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Healthy Aging Program, has as its core mission, to translate effective healthy aging interventions into sustainable community-based programs. Researchers and community-based stakeholders collaborate across HAN’s seven member center and two affiliate universities (Figure ​(Figure1)1) to develop and implement health promotion programs for older adults at individual, organizational, environmental, and policy levels (1–3). This commentary highlights selected HAN contributions to the EBHP movement from 2001 to 2014. These contributions serve as examples of potential models for future partnership efforts to enhance implementation, dissemination, and sustainability of EBHP programs.

Using Social Network Analysis to Assess Mentorship and Collaboration in a Public Health Network,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"Introduction Addressing chronic disease burden requires the creation of collaborative networks to promote systemic changes and engage stakeholders. Although many such networks exist, they are rarely assessed with tools that account for their complexity. This study examined the structure of mentorship and collaboration relationships among members of the Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) using social network analysis (SNA). Methods We invited 97 HAN members and partners to complete an online social network survey that included closed-ended questions about HAN-specific mentorship and collaboration during the previous 12 months. Collaboration was measured by examining the activity of the network on 6 types of products: published articles, in-progress manuscripts, grant applications, tools, research projects, and presentations. We computed network-level measures such as density, number of components, and centralization to assess the cohesiveness of the network. Results Sixty-three respondents completed the survey (response rate, 65%). Responses, which included information about collaboration with nonrespondents, suggested that 74% of HAN members were connected through mentorship ties and that all 97 members were connected through at least one form of collaboration. Mentorship and collaboration ties were present both within and across boundaries of HAN member organizations. Conclusion SNA of public health collaborative networks provides understanding about the structure of relationships that are formed as a result of participation in network activities. This approach may offer members and funders a way to assess the impact of such networks that goes beyond simply measuring products and participation at the individual level."

A systematic review of interventions conducted in clinical or community settings to improve dual-task postural control in older adults,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"Background Injury due to falls is a major problem among older adults. Decrements in dual-task postural control performance (simultaneously performing two tasks, at least one of which requires postural control) have been associated with an increased risk of falling. Evidence-based interventions that can be used in clinical or community settings to improve dual-task postural control may help to reduce this risk. Purpose The aims of this systematic review are: 1) to identify clinical or community-based interventions that improved dual-task postural control among older adults; and 2) to identify the key elements of those interventions. Data sources Studies were obtained from a search conducted through October 2013 of the following electronic databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Study selection Randomized and nonrandomized controlled studies examining the effects of interventions aimed at improving dual-task postural control among community-dwelling older adults were selected. Data extraction All studies were evaluated based on methodological quality. Intervention characteristics including study purpose, study design, and sample size were identified, and effects of dual-task interventions on various postural control and cognitive outcomes were noted. Data synthesis Twenty-two studies fulfilled the selection criteria and were summarized in this review to identify characteristics of successful interventions. Limitations The ability to synthesize data was limited by the heterogeneity in participant characteristics, study designs, and outcome measures. Conclusion Dual-task postural control can be modified by specific training. There was little evidence that single-task training transferred to dual-task postural control performance. Further investigation of dual-task training using standardized outcome measurements is needed."

Food Access Patterns and Barriers among Midlife and Older Adults with Mobility Disabilities,

Year
2012,

Abstract
"We examined where midlife and older adults with a mobility disability accessed food outside the home in King County, Washington, USA, how they travelled to these food destinations, and facilitators and barriers to food access using qualitative interviews. Thirty-five adults aged ≥50 years with a mobility disability (defined as use of an assistive device for mobility) were interviewed. Supplemental objective information was obtained from a Global Positioning System device worn by participants for 3 days. Participants primarily accessed food at grocery stores, restaurants, and coffee shops/cafés. The most common transportation modes were walking, obtaining a ride from friends, motorized chair/scooter, and public transit. Location and proximity of food destinations were factors affecting participants' ability to access these destinations. Adequate space, ease of entry, available amenities such as restrooms, and helpful people were facilitators for participants to access food outside the home."

Community-based aquatic exercise and quality of life in persons with osteoarthritis.,

Year
2010,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based aquatic exercise program for improved quality of life among persons with osteoarthritis.


METHOD
Two hundred forty-nine adults with osteoarthritis were enrolled in a 20-wk randomized controlled trial of a preexisting community-based aquatic exercise program versus control. Intervention group participants (n = 125) were asked to attend at least two aquatic exercise sessions per week. Control group participants (n = 124) were asked to maintain their usual activity levels. Demographics were collected at baseline, and patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and after 10 and 20 wk. Depressive symptoms, self-efficacy for pain and symptom control, physical impairment, and activity limitation were tested as potential mediators of the relationship between aquatic exercise and perceived quality of life (PQOL). Body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, self-rated health, and comorbidity were tested as possible moderators.


RESULTS
Aquatic exercise had a positive impact on PQOL scores (P < 0.01). This effect was moderated by BMI (P < 0.05) such that benefits were observed among obese participants (BMI >or= 30), but not among normal weight or overweight participants. None of the tested variables were found to mediate the relationship between aquatic exercise and PQOL scores.


CONCLUSIONS
Given the availability of existing community aquatics programs, aquatic exercise offers a therapeutic and pragmatic option to promote quality of life among individuals who are living with both obesity and osteoarthritis. Future investigation is needed to replicate these findings and develop strategies to increase long-term participation in aquatics programs."

Fitness support group for organ transplant recipients: self-management, self-efficacy and health status.,

Year

Abstract
"TITLE
Fitness support group for organ transplant recipients: self-management, self-efficacy and health status.


AIM
This paper is a report of a study conducted to describe postoperative self-management behaviours, perceived self-efficacy and health outcomes in adult organ transplant recipients who participated in a fitness support group.


BACKGROUND
Self-management behaviours designed to promote patient autonomy contribute to positive health outcomes after therapeutic interventions. Despite an increase in organ transplantation, little is known about the impact of self-management on health outcomes after adult organ transplantation. Even less has been investigated regarding nursing interventions in the organ transplantation patient demographic to promote positive outcomes.


METHOD
Using a cross-sectional descriptive design, 20 participants completed a questionnaire that included measures of self-management, self-efficacy and health status during the 2006 training season.


FINDINGS
Participants were, on average, 55 years of age and 6 years since transplantation. Their results were compared to mean values as reported in the literature, and revealed consistently superior scores for the outcome variables. The mean amount of weekly aerobic exercise in the transplant group was 3.2 hours (sd 1.4). Participants demonstrated impressively high amounts of self-efficacy. Confidence was inversely related to extent of illness interference in activities of daily life (r = -0.772, P = 0.01). Health status scores also exceeded the norms, with all participants reporting at least 'good' health. Seventeen participants reported zero emergency department visits in the last 6 months. Nursing interventions geared toward maximizing patient self-efficacy may improve health outcomes for adults after solid organ transplantation.


CONCLUSION
Group participation in a fitness programme may support achievement of self-management activities and feelings of self-efficacy in maintaining disease management."

"Pharmacists must collaborate with other health professionals to promote the optimal use of medications, relying on coordinated, interprofessional communication and care to do so. In 2003, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended "all health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics." At the University of Washington, the Center for Health Sciences Interprofessional Education (CHSIE) was established in 1997 to promote interprofessional curricular and clinical innovation in education, faculty development, and student activities, and to conduct evaluative research regarding the impact of interprofessional innovations. In this manuscript, we will describe the Center for Health Sciences Interprofessional Education, and highlight key projects that serve as examples of pharmacy involvement in interprofessional education, research, and service.","

WANTED: clinical experts to teach the next generation of gerontological nursing professionals. Why it's important to be an "early adopter" of the Doctor of Nursing Practice.,

Year
2008,

Abstract
"T statistics are staggering and cited often: Between 2000 and 2030, the U.S. population of older adults is projected to double as the Baby Boomer generation turns 65 (He, Sengupta, Velkoff, & DeBarros, 2005). These increased numbers of older adults bring more complex health care needs, including startling epidemics of obesity and diabetes, and higher acuity during a nursing shortage that is only projected to get worse (Auerbach, Buerhaus, & Staiger, 2007). Escalating retirements of clinical nurse experts and leaders contribute to this worsening nursing shortage (Hader, Saver, & Steltzer, 2006), as do faculty shortages that result in qualified applicants being turned away from undergraduate and graduate nursing programs (American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN], 2007). The expanding number of Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs represents a positive step forward in addressing older adults’ health care acuity and complexity by preparing expert clinicians with enhanced clinical, leadership, and research skills (AACN, 2004). The practice doctorate offers an exciting opportunity for advanced practice nurses (APNs) to strengthen the bridge between gerontological nursing science and practice through practice inquiry. DNP-prepared clinicians will be adept at translating research data into the practice arena to improve care for older adults, as well as generating new approaches to address deficiencies in the health care system. In addition, DNP graduates with clinical expertise in gerontological nursing will be well prepared to provide high-quality mentorship to APNs caring for older adults and address current and future shortages by moving into educator roles at academic institutions (Brown et al., 2006). We invite you to join other “early adopters” of this trend (Hathaway, Jacob, Stegbauer, Thompson, & Graff, 2006), seek DNP preparation, and support the education of DNP graduates with gerontological expertise. Early adopters have a greater opportunity to shape DNP academic programs and clinical practice while demonstrating—to other professionals, policy makers, and funding agencies—that the DNP offers an innovative solution to health care and workforce needs. How can you be an early adopter in ways that will enhance gerontological nursing?"

Paper Title
Effects of aquatic exercise on flexibility, strength and aerobic fitness in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.,

Year
2007,

Abstract
"AIM
This paper reports a study of the effects of aquatic exercise on physical fitness (flexibility, strength and aerobic fitness), self-reported physical functioning and pain in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.


BACKGROUND
Osteoarthritis is a common cause of disability and a primary reason for hip and knee joint replacement. Exercise is important for preventing and/or managing the functional limitations associated with joint disease. Aquatic exercise is thought to be beneficial and is often recommended for people with osteoarthritis; however, few studies have examined the effects on people with osteoarthritis, and these have yielded inconsistent results.


METHODS
A two-group randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample was used. Participants were recruited from community sources and randomly assigned to a 12-week aquatic programme or a non-exercise control condition. Data for 38 participants were collected at baseline, week 6, and week 12 during 2003 and 2004. Instruments were a standard plastic goniometer, a handheld dynamometer, the 6-minute walk test, the multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale for pain.


RESULTS
Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that aquatic exercise statistically significantly improved knee and hip flexibility, strength and aerobic fitness, but had no effect on self-reported physical functioning and pain. The exercise adherence rate was 81.7%, and no exercise-related adverse effect was observed or reported.


CONCLUSIONS
Beneficial short-term effects of aquatic exercise were found in adults with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Although the programme may not offer pain relief or self-reported improvements in physical functioning, results suggest that aquatic exercise does not worsen the joint condition or result in injury. Nurses engaging in disease management and health promotion for these patients should consider recommending or implementing aquatic classes for patients."

Paper Title
“It Is Our Exercise Family”: Experiences of Ethnic Older Adults in a Group-Based Exercise Program,

Year
2007,

Abstract
"Introduction EnhanceFitness (EF) (formerly the Lifetime Fitness Program) is an evidence-based community exercise program for older adults. From 1998 to 2005, participation of ethnic older adults increased significantly. However, little research is available about what ethnic older adults want or need to continue participation in exercise programs. The purpose of this study was to examine how physical environment, social environment, and individual biology and behavior influence adherence to exercise for ethnic older adults participating in EF. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with 52 older adults participating in EF. Facilitators asked questions about factors that helped participants continue exercising in EF. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Transcripts were systematically reviewed using content analysis. Results Focus group participants were Chinese (n = 21, 40%), African American (n = 18, 35%), white (n = 10, 19%), and Japanese (n = 3, 6%). Mean (SD) age was 76 years (7.4). Participants had, on average, participated in EF for 44 months (SD = 37.8). Results revealed four themes related to adherence. First, environmental factors that promoted adherence were location of the classes, transportation, weather, and the facility. Second, design of the exercise program that encouraged adherence included exercise content and type of delivery. Third, social support factors that encouraged adherence were the socializing and support between class participants and support from family, health care providers, and the class instructors. Finally, individual factors that encouraged adherence were personality traits and feelings, past physical activity experience, health benefits, and mental stimulation. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest strategies for developing community-based physical activity programs for older adults from ethnically diverse communities.","

Paper Title
Cerebrovascular dynamics with head-of-bed elevation in patients with mild or moderate vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,

Year
2006,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
In patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, elevation of the head of the bed during vasospasm has been limited in an attempt to minimize vasospasm or its sequelae or both. Consequently, some patients have remained on bed rest for weeks.


OBJECTIVES
To determine how elevations of the head of the bed of 20 degrees and 45 degrees affect cerebrovascular dynamics in adult patients with mild or moderate vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and to describe the response of mild or moderate vasospasm to head-of-bed elevations of 20 degrees and 45 degrees with respect to variables such as grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage and degree of vasospasm.


METHODS
A within-patient repeated-measures design was used. The head of the bed was positioned in the sequence of 0 degrees -20 degrees -45 degrees -0 degrees in 20 patients with mild or moderate vasospasm between days 3 and 14 after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Continuous transcranial Doppler recordings were obtained for 2 to 5 minutes after allowing approximately 2 minutes for stabilization in each position.


RESULTS
No patterns or trends indicated that having the head of the bed elevated increases vasospasm. As a group, there were no significant differences within patients at the different positions of the head of the bed. Utilizing repeated-measures analysis of variance, P values ranged from .34 to .97, well beyond .05. No neurological deterioration occurred.


CONCLUSIONS
In general, elevation of the head of the bed did not cause harmful changes in cerebral blood flow related to vasospasm."

Paper Title
Seattle Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire: sensitivity to outcomes in pulmonary rehabilitation in severe pulmonary illness.,

Year
2005,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
To evaluate the ability of the Seattle Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire (SOLDQ) to detect change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) and to determine associations with other functional indicators.


METHODS
A prospective pre- and post-test design. A PRP was offered for 60 minutes, 2 times per week for 8 weeks. Measured at entry and exit to the PRP: the SOLDQ (physical, emotional, and coping skills), 6-minute walk, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey-36 Veterans (SF-36V) (physical and mental), Lareau Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale. Setting was an outpatient PRP in a VA Medical Center.


RESULTS
Participants included 58 adults who completed the PRP (age mean = 66, SD +/- 9.8; FEV1% predicted mean = 39, SD +/- 15.9). At baseline, significant correlations were found between SOLDQ physical functioning and SF-36V physical, dyspnea, fatigue, 6-minute walk distance, SF-36V mental, and spirometry. SOLDQ emotional functioning significantly correlated with fatigue, dyspnea, and SF-36V mental and physical. SOLDQ coping skills significantly correlated with fatigue, dyspnea, and SF-36V mental and physical. Paired, 2-tailed, t tests comparing the SOLDQ subscales pre- and post-program were significant, with the biggest treatment effect seen with emotional functioning. Other measures showing significant improvement included 6-minute walk, SF-36V physical, dyspnea, and fatigue.


CONCLUSIONS
After participation in a PRP, all 3 SOLDQ subscales improved significantly and were associated with other indicators of function. These findings validate the SOLDQ as a measure sensitive to functional changes associated with participation in pulmonary rehabilitation."

Older Adult Perspectives on Physical Activity and Exercise: Voices From Multiple Cultures,

Year
2004,

Abstract
"Introduction Increasing physical activity is a goal of Healthy People 2010. Although the health benefits of physical activity are documented, older adults are less physically active than any other age group. The purpose of this study was to examine barriers and facilitators to physical activity and exercise among underserved, ethnically diverse older adults. Methods Seventy-one older adults were recruited through community agencies to participate in seven ethnic-specific focus groups: American Indian/Alaska Native, African American, Filipino, Chinese, Latino, Korean, and Vietnamese. Groups were conducted in the participants' primary language and ranged in size from 7–13 participants. Mean age was 71.6 years (range from 52 to 85 years; SD ± 7.39). Professional translators transcribed audiotapes into the language of the group and then translated the transcript into English. Transcripts were systematically reviewed using content analysis. Results Suggested features of physical activity programs to enhance participation among ethnically diverse minority older adults included fostering relationships among participants; providing culture-specific exercise; offering programs at residential sites; partnering with and offering classes prior to or after social service programs; educating families about the importance of physical activity for older adults and ways they could help; offering low- or no-cost classes; and involving older adults in program development. Walking was the exercise of choice across all ethnic groups. Health served as both a motivator and a barrier to physical activity. Other factors influencing physical activity were weather, transportation, and personal safety. Conclusion Findings from this study suggest strategies for culture-specific programming of community-based physical activity programs."

Health and safety risk at a skilled nursing facility. Nursing assistants' perceptions.,

Year
2003,

Abstract
"Little is known about the perceptions nursing assistants certified (NAC) have related to their occupational health and safety risks and how these perceptions influence the safety precautions taken. The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of the occupational health and safety risks perceived by NAC, along with determining the protective mechanisms they used to prevent injury and illness. Ten NAC employed by a skilled nursing facility were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Numerous hazards and protective mechanisms were identified and these were categorized and environmental, physical or cognitive in nature. Based on the NAC perceptions of their occupational hazards, there were a number of areas in which they were ignorant to concepts the administration believed to be readily available. While the facility has a number of health promotion and safety programs already in place, these alone seem inadequate to meet the perceived needs of the NAC. Strategies are needed in three specific areas to address the knowledge deficits and enhance the overall effectiveness of improving the health and safety of the NAC--communication, fostering teamwork, and educational and training opportunities.","

Paper Title
Testing the effectiveness of an osteoporosis educational program for nursing students in Thailand.,

Year
2001,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
Osteoporosis, a health problem that is on the rise, has received considerable attention among the health care community and the public. The majority of primary prevention programs for osteoporosis have been focused on women in mid-life. A concern is that young women may not be aware of osteoporosis risk factors and therefore may not be engaging in preventive behaviors. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an osteoporosis educational program for young women.


METHODS
A sample of 100 female undergraduate students who were enrolled in the first year of a nursing program in Thailand were randomly assigned to a control group or an experimental group. Participants in the experimental group participated in a 3-hour osteoporosis educational program (OEP). At entry to and exit from the study, all participants completed the Osteoporosis Knowledge Test, the Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale, and the Osteoporosis Self-Efficacy Scale.


RESULTS
The experimental group had higher change scores for knowledge, health belief, and self-efficacy than the control group. The OEP increased knowledge of osteoporosis in these young women.


CONCLUSION
These findings indicate the need for further health education concerning the importance of dietary calcium and exercise on osteoporosis prevention in young women."

Use of alternative therapies by older adults with osteoarthritis.,

Year
2001,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
To examine the rates of use and expenditures on alternative therapies by adults with osteoarthritis (OA).


METHODS
Adults with OA recruited from the community to participate in a randomized clinical trial recorded alternative and traditional health care use on postcard diaries. General and arthritis-specific quality of life was assessed by questionnaires.


RESULTS
More than 47% of participants reported using at least one type of alternative care during the 20-week intervention period. Among alternative care consumers, the most commonly used treatments were massage therapy (57%), chiropractic services (20.7%), and nonprescribed alternative medications (17.2%). Four percent of subjects reported using only alternative care during the study period. Expenditures for alternative therapy averaged $1,127 per year, compared with $1,148 for traditional therapies.


CONCLUSION
Use of and expenditures for alternative care were high among this cohort of older adults with OA. Clinicians may want to inquire about use of these therapies before recommending treatments for this condition."

Quantitating physical activity in COPD using a triaxial accelerometer.,

Year
2000,

Abstract
"STUDY OBJECTIVE
To determine the reliability, validity, and stability of a triaxial accelerometer for walking and daily activity measurement in a COPD sample.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive design.


SETTING
Outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program in a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Forty-seven outpatients (44 men and 3 women) with stable COPD (FEV(1), 37% predicted; SD, 16%) prior to entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation program.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
Test-retest reliability of a triaxial movement sensor (Tritrac R3D Research Ergometer; Professional Products; Madison, WI) was evaluated in 35 of the 47 subjects during three standardized 6-min walks (intraclass correlation coefficient [rICC] = 0.84). Pearson correlations evaluated accelerometer concurrent validity as a measure of walking (in vector magnitude units), compared to walking distance in all 47 subjects during three sequential 6-min walks (0. 84, 0.85, and 0.95, respectively; p < 0.001). The validity of the accelerometer as a measure of daily activity over 3 full days at home was evaluated in all subjects using Pearson correlations with other indicators of functional capacity. The accelerometer correlated with exercise capacity (maximal 6-min walk, r = 0.74; p < 0.001); level of obstructive disease (FEV(1) percent predicted, r = 0.62; p < 0.001); dyspnea (Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire, dyspnea over the past 30 days, r = - 0.29; p < 0.05); and activity self-efficacy (Activity Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, r = 0.43; p < 0.01); but not with self-report of daily activity (Modified Activity Recall Questionnaire, r = 0.14; not significant). Stability of the accelerometer to measure 3 full days of activity at home was determined by an rICC of 0.69.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides preliminary data suggesting that a triaxial movement sensor is a reliable, valid, and stable measure of walking and daily physical activity in COPD patients. It has the potential to provide more precise measurement of everyday physical functioning in this population than self-report measures currently in use, and measures an important dimension of functional status not previously well-described."

Maintaining health in well older adults: initiatives for schools of nursing and The John A. Hartford Foundation for the 21st century.,

Year
2000,

Abstract
"In the past century, there has been a substantial increase in the number of older Americans and an increase in their life expectancy at birth. These trends will continue over the next century, marked by further increases in active life expectancy and marked changes in the racial and ethnic composition of the older population. While nursing has traditionally focused on the care of frail older individuals, most older adults--well older adults--enjoy a relatively high level of health and function. In this article, well older adults are defined as those with the physical, mental, social, and spiritual function or resources to meet the needs of everyday living. Recommendations for improving care of well older adults are provided, including reconceptualizing ways of thinking, expanding practice initiatives, building the science of nursing research in geriatrics and gerontology, developing education and training opportunities, and rethinking individual safety within the context of autonomy."

Use of an Unguided, Web-Based Distress Self-Management Program After Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Sub-Analysis of CaringGuidance Pilot Study (Preprint),

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 BACKGROUND
 Unguided, web-based psychoeducational interventions are gaining interest as a way to reach patients while reducing pressure on clinical resources. However, there has been little research on how patients with cancer use these interventions.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 The objective of this analysis was to evaluate how women newly diagnosed with breast cancer used the unguided web-based, psychoeducational distress self-management program CaringGuidance After Breast Cancer Diagnosis while enrolled in a pilot feasibility study.
 
 
 METHODS
 Women with stage 0 to II breast cancer diagnosed within the prior three months were recruited from clinics primarily in the Northeastern United States for participation in a 12-week pilot study of CaringGuidance plus usual care versus usual care alone. Usage prompts included sets of emails sent weekly for 12 weeks; standardized congratulatory emails after every two hours of program use, and informative emails for each cognitive-behavioral exercise. Individual user activity on the site was automatically tracked by an analytics system and recorded directly in the CaringGuidance database.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Complete usage data were available for 54 subjects. Ninety-eight percent of the intervention group logged into CaringGuidance independently at least once. Thirty-eight (70%) logged in during all three months, 15 (28%) were intermittent users, and one (2%) was a non-user. Users (n=53) averaged 15.6 (SD 9.85) logins. Mean logins were greatest in month 1 (7.26, SD 4.02) and declined in months 2 (4.32, SD 3.66) and month 3 (4.02, SD 3.82). Eleven (21%) used CaringGuidance with both the frequency and activity level intended at study outset, 9 (17%) exceeded intended frequency and activity (high-high users), and 10 (19%) were below expected usage on both login frequency and activity (low-low users). Low-low users and high-high users differed significantly (P<.001) in the total number of views and unique views of all program components. Change in depressive symptoms and the number of sessions (r=.351) and logins (r=.348) between study months 1 and 2 were significantly correlated (P=.018, .019). Higher baseline distress was associated with more unique views of program resources (r=.281, P=.043). Change in intrusive/avoidant thoughts from baseline to month 3, and the number of users’ unique exercise views were negatively correlated (r=–.319, P=.035) so that more unique exercise views, equated with greater decline in intrusive/avoidant thoughts from baseline to month 3.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 These findings favor the hypothesis that the key ingredient is not the amount of program use, but each user’s self-selected activity within the program. More research is needed on the ideal ways to maintain use, and capture and define engagement and enactment of behaviors by people with cancer accessing unguided, self-management web-based programs.

1138 Gender, Inflammation, and Cognition Affect the Sleep Trajectories of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Survivors,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"
 
 
 Sleep disturbance after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) impacts recovery and rehabilitation. Longitudinal studies examining trajectories of sleep are needed to understand patients’ experiences of sleep over time. We aimed to identify subgroups of SAH survivors based on distinct trajectories of sleep during the first 6 months post-SAH and determine whether they vary according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, inflammatory biomarkers (Toll-like receptor 4, Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha [TNF-α], Interleukin [IL]-1 beta, and IL-6), and symptoms-related characteristics (depression/anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, and cognition).
 
 
 
 We conducted a 6-month longitudinal study of 40 SAH survivors (average age: 56.9 years, 32.5% male). Multi-trajectory latent class growth analysis was used to identify salient patient groupings based on the trajectories of objective sleep parameters—sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST)—assessed using actigraphy at 2, 3, and 6 months. Sociodemographic, clinical, and symptom-related characteristics (at 2 months) and inflammatory biomarkers (at 2, 3, and 7 days and 2 months) were compared among trajectory groups using bivariate analyses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.1.
 
 
 
 Two trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (n = 24; “high SE/short SOL/short WASO/adequate TST”) and Group 2 (n = 16; “low SE/long SOL/long WASO/insufficient TST”). The mean scores of all sleep parameters remained stable across all three time points (2, 3, and 6 months) in both groups, except for SOL, which significantly decreased in Group 2, but remained higher than that of Group 1. Individuals in Group 1 (vs. Group 2) were more likely to be female and had lower plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 at days 3 and 7 post-SAH, respectively. Individuals in Group 1 (vs. Group 2) performed better in the following cognitive domains: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, attention, and delayed memory tasks at 2 months.
 
 
 
 Significant differences between the two trajectory groups were observed in gender proportion, TNF-α and IL-6 plasma levels, and cognitive domains. These findings may help healthcare providers identify patients at risk of developing sleep disturbances. Our study suggests inflammation as a plausible mechanism of sleep disturbances.

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH STROKE,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Abstract Older adults with stroke often experience physical and mental disabilities, resulting in limitations on social functioning, such as participating in social roles and activities. Social determinants of health (SDOH), such as education and income, are shown to have an impact on morbidity and mortality in stroke survivors. However, little is known about the impact of SDOH on social functioning in older adults with stroke. We aimed to examine the associations between SDOH (i.e., marital status, race/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio [PIR], work status, and health insurance status) and social functioning (i.e., difficulty doing errands alone, participating in social activities, and work limitations due to health problems) in older adults with stroke. We used the National Health Interview Survey 2019-2022 data, which had 61,957 participants aged 60 years and older, including 4,163 stroke survivors. We used logistic regression to examine the associations between SDOH and social functioning after adjusting for covariates, including age, sex, and perceived health status. Being a racial/ethnic minority and not working over the previous week were associated with difficulty doing errands alone. Not being married, being Hispanic or non-Hispanic Asian, and not working over the previous week were associated with difficulty participating in social activities. Not being married, having a PIR < 1 (income below the federal poverty threshold), and not working over the previous week were associated with work limitations due to health problems. Addressing SDOH in care plans for older adults with stroke may improve social functioning and quality of life in this at-risk population."

Cognitive Impairment After Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Purpose: Cognitive impairment is a common consequence of stroke and has direct implications for poststroke functioning and quality of life, including the ability to maintain a job, live independently, sustain interpersonal relationships, and drive a vehicle. In this scientific statement, we critically appraise the literature on the prevalence, diagnosis, and management of poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and provide a framework for clinical care while highlighting gaps that merit further study. Methods: We performed a scoping literature review of randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, clinical guidelines, review articles, and editorials on the incidence and prevalence, natural history, diagnosis, and management of PSCI. Scoping reviews determine the scope of a body of literature on a given topic to indicate the volume of literature and the studies currently available and provide an overview of its focus. Results: PSCI is common after stroke, especially in the first year, and ranges from mild to severe. Although cognitive impairment is reversible in some cases early after stroke, up to one-third of individuals with stroke develop dementia within 5 years. The pathophysiology is not yet fully elucidated but is likely attributable to an acute stroke precipitating a series of pathological events, often in the setting of preexisting microvascular and neurodegenerative changes. Screening for associated comorbidities and interdisciplinary management are integral components of the care of individuals with PSCI. There is a need for prospective studies evaluating the individual trajectory of PSCI and the role of the acute vascular event in the predisposition for Alzheimer disease and related dementias, as well as high-quality, randomized clinical trials focused on PSCI management."

Fatigue, Toll-Like Receptor 4, and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Adults With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A 6-Month Longitudinal Study,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Fatigue is prevalent in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) survivors. Biological mechanisms underlying fatigue post-SAH are not clear. Inflammation may contribute to the development of fatigue. This study aimed to examine the associations between inflammatory markers and fatigue during the first 6 months post-SAH. Specific biomarkers examined included both early and concurrent expression of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin (IL)1β, and IL6. Methods We conducted a 6-month longitudinal study with a convenience sample of 43 SAH survivors. We collected blood samples on days 2, 3, and 7 and 2, 3, and 6 months post-SAH to assess biomarkers. Fatigue was assessed by the PROMIS Fatigue Scale at 2, 3, and 6 months. Linear mixed models were used to test the associations between early (days 2, 3, and 7) and concurrent (2, 3, and 6 months) TLR4 mRNA expression (TagMan gene expression assays) and TNF-α, IL1β, and IL6 plasma concentrations (multiplex assays) and concurrent fatigue. Results 28% of SAH survivors experienced fatigue during the first 6 months post-SAH. Fatigue levels in SAH survivors were higher than those of the U.S. population and consistent during the 6 months. Experience of fatigue during the 6 months post-SAH was associated with higher IL1β plasma concentrations on day 7 and IL1β, IL6, and TNF-α plasma concentrations during the 6 months post-SAH. Conclusion Inflammation appears to underlie the development of fatigue in SAH survivors."

SOCIAL INTEGRATION, COGNITION, AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME IN OLDER ADULTS FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Abstract Persons aged 65 and older have the highest rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and this injury is known to be related to significant, persistent functional changes. What is not known is what factors may mediate these changes. The current study aimed 1) to examine interrelationships among social integration, functional outcome, and cognition in older adults at years 1, 2, and 5 post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 2) to examine if functional outcome mediates the concurrent and longitudinal relationships between social integration and cognitive function post-TBI in older adults. This is a secondary analysis of data obtained from Traumatic Brain Injury Model System National Database (TBIMS-NDB). Included subjects from the database were persons aged 65 years and older at the time of injury (N=1469). We used longitudinal mediation analysis to address study aims. We found that social integration had a direct effect on functional outcome and cognition at 1, 2, and 5-years post-TBI. Functional outcome had a positive direct effect on concurrent cognitive function. Regarding mediation, social integration and cognition were mediated by concurrent functional outcome. However, there were no significant mediating effects of concurrent functional outcome on concurrent social integration or subsequent cognitive function. Our findings suggest there are positive relationships between social integration, functional outcome, and cognition over time. With a better understanding of these interrelationships, tailored interventions that target social integration, such as activities fostering a sense of belonging in the community and cultural diversity programs may promote improved functional and cognitive outcomes."

Paper Title
The Perceived Meaning of Traumatic Brain Injury for Older Adults: A Longitudinal-Multiple Case Study,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the perceived meaning of traumatic brain injury (TBI) over the first-year postinjury among older adults and to explore if and how meaning changes. Design A longitudinal multiple-case study design was used. Methods Semistructured face-to-face interviews were completed at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postinjury. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results Fifty-five interviews were conducted with 12 participants. Four themes were identified: gratitude, vulnerability and dependence, slowing down and being more careful, and a chance for reflecting on life. Most participants’ perceptions of their TBI remained either consistently positive or negative over the first-year postinjury. Clinical Relevance Nurses should elicit and support patients’ positive illness perceptions regarding their brain injury, which can contribute to a higher quality of life. For those patients with negative illness perceptions, nurses should provide resources in order to support coping and resilience following brain injury. Conclusions This study is the first study to explore individual perceptions over time of the meaning made from experiencing TBI among older adults. Findings can serve as a foundation for tailored supportive interventions among older adults following TBI to maximize quality of life."

Paper Title
Social integration: A concept analysis.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
In recent decades, social isolation has been increasingly linked to serious health conditions. However, social integration (SI) is a complex concept that has not been systematically explored or defined in nursing. It is essential for nurses and healthcare providers to have a clearer concept of SI to better provide holistic care to support optimal health.


PURPOSE
This concept analysis aimed to clarify the concept of SI in health research and to identify attributes, antecedents, and consequences of the concept of SI to enhance understanding of the concept and its implications for human health.


METHODS
Walker and Avant's framework was used as the methodology for the concept analysis of SI. A literature search using PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases on SI was conducted with keywords: "integration," "social integration," "social relationships," "social participation," "community integration," "socialization." Studies included in the search were published from 2001 to 2021.


RESULTS
SI is affected by multidimensional individual, societal, and environmental factors. Defining attributes are productive activities, social relationships, community engagement, and leisure activities. SI is effective in promoting multiple aspects of health as well as healthy aging and overall well-being.


CONCLUSION
The analysis contributes to a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of SI and contributes to helping nurses better understand patients' circumstances that promote or inhibit SI. This knowledge will support the development of interventions that support optimal health and well-being, in assisting patients to remain integrated or reintegrate into society during and following an illness or injury."

Paper Title
1140 Sleep Disturbances, Lifestyle, And Self-Management In Adults With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 
 
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) survivors often suffer sleep disturbances. Self-management strategies focusing on lifestyle changes and health-promoting behaviors may improve sleep in SAH survivors. Few studies have examined sleep in SAH survivors, and little is known about sleep management practices used to improve their sleep. The purposes of this study were to: 1) describe the prevalence of sleep disturbances using subjective and objective sleep measures, and 2) explore interest in and engagement with self-management practices to promote sleep health in SAH survivors.
 
 
 
 We conducted a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of 30 SAH survivors recruited from a university hospital. We assessed sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and objective sleep using wrist actigraphy. We conducted content analysis of semi-structured interviews, with two authors each coding sleep disturbances and self-management practices addressing sleep.
 
 
 
 Seventy-three percent of SAH survivors reported poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) and 27% had daytime sleepiness (ESS > 10). Actigraphy analysis indicated that 41% of SAH survivors slept less than 7 hours or more than 9 hours. Interview content analyses suggested 3 themes and 15 sub-categories: 1) Sleep disturbances (difficulties in falling asleep, wake after sleep onset, daytime sleepiness, too much or insufficient sleep, and poor sleep quality), 2) Sleep management practices (exercise, regular sleep schedule, relaxation, keeping busy and staying active, changing beverage intake, taking supplements, taking medication, recharging energy, and barriers to sleep management), and 3) Healthcare providers (discussing sleep problems with health care providers).
 
 
 
 Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and an urgent need exists to focus on improving sleep in SAH survivors. Developing tailored interventions that incorporate self-management and lifestyle change would be a critical next step to improve sleep and promote health in this at-risk population.

Paper Title
Brief Psychosocial Intervention to Address Poststroke Depression May Also Benefit Fatigue and Sleep–Wake Disturbance,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"Abstract Purpose This study aimed to determine if brief psychosocial/behavioral therapy directed to reduce poststroke depression would decrease fatigue and improve sleep–wake disturbance. Design A preplanned secondary data analysis from a completed clinical trial was conducted. Methods One hundred participants received usual care, in-person intervention, or telephone intervention. Depression, fatigue, and sleep–wake disturbance were measured at entry, 8 weeks, 21 weeks, and 12 months following the intervention. Findings Fatigue (within: p = .042, between: p = .394), sleep disturbance (within: p = .024, between: p = .102), and wake disturbance (within: p = .004, between: p = .508) decreased over the 12 months in the intervention groups, but not in the control group. This difference was clinically meaningful for wake disturbance and approached the clinically important difference for fatigue. Conclusions/Clinical Relevance Reduction in wake disturbance was consistent with clinically meaningful difference standards for patient-reported outcomes, warranting further research in larger samples.","

Paper Title
Depressive symptoms in caregivers immediately after stroke,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT Background: Caregivers of stroke survivors often suffer depressive symptoms that interfere with their own health. Early recognition may lead to attenuation of symptoms and better health and well-being for caregivers. Objective: We examined characteristics of caregivers and stroke survivors associated with caregivers’ depressive symptoms in the early poststroke period. Methods: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal exploratory observational study with a convenience sample of 63 caregivers of older adult (≥ 65 years) stroke survivors recruited from urban acute-care settings. We enrolled caregivers by 2 weeks poststroke (T1) and revisited them 4 weeks later (T2). Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A separate unadjusted linear mixed model was computed to explore significant associations between each caregiver or stroke-survivor characteristic and depressive symptoms. Results: Caregivers, on average, reported mild depressive symptoms at T1 and T2. Each of the following characteristics was independently associated with caregiver depressive symptoms over the first 6 weeks poststroke: caregiver uncertainty (p < 0.001), perceived stress (p < 0.001) but not cortisol levels (p = 0.858 on waking, p = 0.231 evening), coping (p < 0.001), social support (p = 0.006), race (p = 0.022), income (p = 0.001), time spent on care (p = 0.039), and stroke-survivor race (p = 0.033) and functional status (p = 0.003). At T2, caregiver depressive symptoms were correlated with evening cortisol level (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Caregiver and stroke-survivor characteristics may help identify caregivers at highest risk for early depressive symptoms and guide interventions aimed at their resolution."

Effects of Uncertainty on Perceived and Physiological Stress in Caregivers of Stroke Survivors: A 6-Week Longitudinal Study.,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Caregivers' stress following a family member's stroke is likely accentuated by its associated uncertainty. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of uncertainty on caregivers' perceived and physiological stress (i.e., salivary cortisol). A prospective, longitudinal observational study was conducted with a convenience sample of 40 caregivers and stroke survivors recruited from acute care settings. Linear mixed models were used. Greater uncertainty was associated with higher perceived stress (p < 0.001), but not with physiological stress (p = 0.32 on waking, p = 0.06 evening), over the first 6 weeks post-stroke. A significant association between uncertainty and evening salivary cortisol level was found at 6 weeks post-stroke (p = 0.009). Recognition of uncertainty early in the caregiving period and targeted interventions may be useful in reducing perceived stress for this group. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 43(11), 30-40.]."

Paper Title
Abstract NS6: Factors Affecting Uncertainty in Caregivers of Stroke Survivors,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"Caregiving for stroke survivors is a known risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Little has been reported on caregiving in the early poststroke period, a time when uncertainty is probably at its highest. Uncertainty has been related to poor health outcomes in other populations. In the early poststroke period caregivers may be uncertain about the potential for recovery and their sudden assumption of the new caregiver role, but factors affecting uncertainty in these caregivers are not known.
 
 Methods:
 We conducted a prospective, longitudinal observational study and recruited 40 caregivers (68% female, mean age 58±14.22 years, 60% children) and their stroke-survivor relatives (38% male, mean age 76±7.80 years) from acute care settings in the northeastern US. We measured caregivers’ uncertainty using the Perception of Uncertainty in Illness Scale for Family Members (range: 31-155, higher scores: greater uncertainty) and collected caregiver and stroke-survivor sociodemographic, clinical and response characteristics (e.g., coping capacity, caregiver comorbidity, social support, severity of stroke and stroke-survivor functional status and comorbidity) by self-report and chart abstraction. Multivariate stepwise regression was used to examine factors affecting uncertainty within 2 weeks following stroke (T1) and at 6 weeks poststroke (T2).
 
 
 Results:
 Uncertainty was high in caregivers at both time points (T1: 83.73±23.47, T2: 85.23±23.94). Caregiver older age (
 p
 = 0.001 at T1 and T2) and lower coping capacity (
 p
 < 0.001 at T1 and T2) at both time points and stroke-survivor lower functional status at T1 (
 p
 = 0.047) were associated with greater caregiver uncertainty.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Caregivers experience persistently high uncertainty during the first 6 weeks poststroke. Caregiver age and coping capacity and stroke-survivor functional status may help identify stroke-survivor caregivers at highest risk for early uncertainty. These caregivers may be in the greatest need of interventions.

Paper Title
Time to take stock: a meta-analysis and systematic review of analgesic treatment disparities for pain in the United States.,

Year
2012,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
The recent Institute of Medicine Report assessing the state of pain care in the United States acknowledged the lack of consistent data to describe the nature and magnitude of unrelieved pain and identify subpopulations with disproportionate burdens.


OBJECTIVES
We synthesized 20 years of cumulative evidence on racial/ethnic disparities in analgesic treatment for pain in the United States. Evidence was examined for the 1) magnitude of association between race/ethnicity and analgesic treatment; 2) subgroups at an increased risk; and 3) the effect of moderators (pain type, setting, study quality, and data collection period) on this association.


METHODS
United States studies with at least one explicit aim or analysis comparing analgesic treatment for pain between Whites and a minority group were included (SciVerse Scopus database, 1989-2011).


RESULTS
Blacks/African Americans experienced both a higher number and magnitude of disparities than any other group in the analyses. Opioid treatment disparities were ameliorated for Hispanics/Latinos for "traumatic/surgical" pain (P = 0.293) but remained for "non-traumatic/nonsurgical" pain (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-0.77, P = 0.000). For Blacks/African Americans, opioid prescription disparities were present for both types of pain and were starker for "non-traumatic/nonsurgical" pain (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59-0.75, P = 0.000). In subanalyses, opioid treatment disparities for Blacks/African Americans remained consistent across pain types, settings, study quality, and data collection periods.


CONCLUSION
Our study quantifies the magnitude of analgesic treatment disparities in subgroups of minorities. The size of the difference was sufficiently large to raise not only normative but quality and safety concerns. The treatment gap does not appear to be closing with time or existing policy initiatives. A concerted strategy is needed to reduce pain care disparities within the larger quality of care initiatives."

Paper Title
MRI Quantification of Cortical Bone Porosity, Mineralization, and Morphologic Structure in Postmenopausal Osteoporosis.,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Preclinical studies have suggested that solid-state MRI markers of cortical bone porosity, morphologic structure, mineralization, and osteoid density are useful measures of bone health. Purpose To explore whether MRI markers of cortical bone porosity, morphologic structure, mineralization, and osteoid density are affected in postmenopausal osteoporosis (OP) and to examine associations between MRI markers and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. Materials and Methods In this single-center study, postmenopausal women were prospectively recruited from January 2019 to October 2020 into two groups: participants with OP who had not undergone treatment, defined as having any dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) T-score of -2.5 or less, and age-matched control participants without OP (hereafter, non-OP). Participants underwent MRI in the midtibia, along with DXA in the hip and spine, and peripheral quantitative CT in the midtibia. Specifically, MRI measures of cortical bone porosity (pore water and total water), osteoid density (bound water [BW]), morphologic structure (cortical bone thickness), and mineralization (phosphorous [P] density [31P] and 31P-to-BW concentration ratio) were quantified at 3.0 T. MRI measures were compared between OP and non-OP groups and correlations with BMD were assessed. Results Fifteen participants with OP (mean age, 63 years ± 5 [SD]) and 19 participants without OP (mean age, 65 years ± 6) were evaluated. The OP group had elevated pore water (11.6 mol/L vs 9.5 mol/L; P = .007) and total water densities (21.2 mol/L vs 19.7 mol/L; P = .03), and had lower cortical bone thickness (4.8 mm vs 5.6 mm; P < .001) and 31P density (6.4 mol/L vs 7.5 mol/L; P = .01) than the non-OP group, respectively, although there was no evidence of a difference in BW or 31P-to-BW concentration ratio. Pore and total water densities were inversely associated with DXA and peripheral quantitative CT BMD (P < .001), whereas cortical bone thickness and 31P density were positively associated with DXA and peripheral quantitative CT BMD (P = .01). BW, 31P density, and 31P-to-BW concentration ratio were positively associated with DXA (P < .05), but not with peripheral quantitative CT. Conclusion Solid-state MRI of cortical bone was able to help detect potential impairments in parameters reflecting porosity, morphologic structure, and mineralization in postmenopausal osteoporosis. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Paper Title
Ultrasound-based sensors to monitor physiological motion.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
Medical procedures can be difficult to perform on anatomy that is constantly moving. Respiration displaces internal organs by up to several centimeters with respect to the surface of the body, and patients often have limited ability to hold their breath. Strategies to compensate for motion during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures require reliable information to be available. However, current devices often monitor respiration indirectly, through changes on the outline of the body, and they may be fixed to floors or ceilings, and thus unable to follow a given patient through different locations. Here we show that small ultrasound-based sensors referred to as 'organ configuration motion' (OCM) sensors can be fixed to the abdomen and/or chest and provide information-rich, breathing related signals.


METHODS
By design, the proposed sensors are relatively inexpensive. Breathing waveforms were obtained from tissues at varying depths and/or using different sensor placements. Validation was performed against breathing waveforms derived from MRI and optical tracking signals, in five and eight volunteers, respectively.


RESULTS
Breathing waveforms from different modalities were scaled so they could be directly compared. Differences between waveforms were expressed in the form of a percentage, as compared to the amplitude of a typical breath. Expressed in this manner, for shallow tissues, OCM-derived waveforms on average differed from MRI and optical tracking results by 13.1% and 15.5%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
The present results suggest that the proposed sensors provide measurements that properly characterize breathing states. While OCM-based waveforms from shallow tissues proved similar in terms of information content to those derived from MRI or optical tracking, OCM further captured depth-dependent and position-dependent (i.e., chest and abdomen) information. In time, the richer information content of OCM-based waveforms may enable better respiratory gating to be performed, to allow diagnostic and therapeutic equipment to perform at their best."

Paper Title
Ultrasound-based sensors for respiratory motion assessment in multimodality PET imaging,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Breathing motion can displace internal organs by up to several cm; as such, it is a primary factor limiting image quality in medical imaging. Motion can also complicate matters when trying to fuse images from different modalities, acquired at different locations and/or on different days. Currently available devices for monitoring breathing motion often do so indirectly, by detecting changes in the outline of the torso rather than the internal motion itself, and these devices are often fixed to floors, ceilings or walls, and thus cannot accompany patients from one location to another. We have developed small ultrasound-based sensors, referred to as ‘organ configuration motion’ (OCM) sensors, that attach to the skin and provide rich motion-sensitive information. In the present work we tested the ability of OCM sensors to enable respiratory gating during in vivo PET imaging. A motion phantom involving an FDG solution was assembled, and two cancer patients scheduled for a clinical PET/CT exam were recruited for this study. OCM signals were used to help reconstruct phantom and in vivo data into time series of motion-resolved images. As expected, the motion-resolved images captured the underlying motion. In Patient #1, a single large lesion proved to be mostly stationary through the breathing cycle. However, in Patient #2, several small lesions were mobile during breathing, and our proposed new approach captured their breathing-related displacements. In summary, a relatively inexpensive hardware solution was developed here for respiration monitoring. Because the proposed sensors attach to the skin, as opposed to walls or ceilings, they can accompany patients from one procedure to the next, potentially allowing data gathered in different places and at different times to be combined and compared in ways that account for breathing motion."

Synthesizing Dynamic MRI Using Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Networks,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"A method is proposed for converting raw ultrasound signals of respiratory organ motion into high frame rate dynamic MRI using a long-term recurrent convolutional neural network. Ultrasound signals were acquired using a single-element transducer, referred to here as ‘organ-configuration motion’ (OCM) sensor, while sagittal MR images were simultaneously acquired. Both streams of data were used for training a cascade of convolutional layers, to extract relevant features from raw ultrasound, followed by a recurrent neural network, to learn its temporal dynamics. The network was trained with MR images on the output, and was employed to predict MR images at a temporal resolution of 100 frames per second, based on ultrasound input alone, without any further MR scanner input. The method was validated on 7 subjects."

Paper Title
Influence of amplitude-related perfusion parameters in the parotid glands by non-fat-saturated dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
To verify whether quantification of parotid perfusion is affected by fat signals on non-fat-saturated (NFS) dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and whether the influence of fat is reduced with fat saturation (FS).


METHODS
This study consisted of three parts. First, a retrospective study analyzed DCE-MRI data previously acquired on different patients using NFS (n = 18) or FS (n = 18) scans. Second, a phantom study simulated the signal enhancements in the presence of gadolinium contrast agent at six concentrations and three fat contents. Finally, a prospective study recruited nine healthy volunteers to investigate the influence of fat suppression on perfusion quantification on the same subjects. Parotid perfusion parameters were derived from NFS and FS DCE-MRI data using both pharmacokinetic model analysis and semiquantitative parametric analysis. T tests and linear regression analysis were used for statistical analysis with correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
NFS scans showed lower amplitude-related parameters, including parameter A, peak enhancement (PE), and slope than FS scans in the patients (all with P < 0.0167). The relative signal enhancement in the phantoms was proportional to the dose of contrast agent and was lower in NFS scans than in FS scans. The volunteer study showed lower parameter A (6.75 ± 2.38 a.u.), PE (42.12% ± 14.87%), and slope (1.43% ± 0.54% s(-1)) in NFS scans as compared to 17.63 ± 8.56 a.u., 104.22% ± 25.15%, and 9.68% ± 1.67% s(-1), respectively, in FS scans (all with P < 0.005). These amplitude-related parameters were negatively associated with the fat content in NFS scans only (all with P < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
On NFS DCE-MRI, quantification of parotid perfusion is adversely affected by the presence of fat signals for all amplitude-related parameters. The influence could be reduced on FS scans."

Paper Title
Temporal Evolution of Parotid Volume and Parotid Apparent Diffusion Coefficient in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients Treated by Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Investigated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Pilot Study,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"Purpose To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 ± 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results The parotid volume was 26.2 ± 8.0 cm3 before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 ± 0.15 × 10−3 mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 ± 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 ± 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P < .005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 ± 13.0%, 26.1 ± 13.5%, and 17.1 ± 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P < .005 at stage 1 and 2, P < .05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 ± 17.4%, 27.0 ± 12.8%, and 20.2 ± 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P < .001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P = .0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P = .00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P < .0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P < .0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P = .015). Conclusion Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands."

Paper Title
Parotid fat contents in healthy subjects evaluated with iterative decomposition with echo asymmetry and least squares fat-water separation.,

Year
2013,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
To evaluate the effectiveness of three fat measurement methods for parotid glands in healthy subjects, with or without metallic dental implants.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The institutional review board approved this study, with informed consent obtained from 114 volunteers undergoing magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5 T. Fat-saturated (FS) and non-fat-saturated (NFS) fast spin-echo T1-weighted imaging (T1 method), FS and NFS T2-weighted periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction fast spin-echo imaging (T2 method), and gradient-echo imaging with fat-water separation using iterative decomposition with echo asymmetry and least squares (IDEAL) method were used to derive parotid fat contents. Two raters examined the homogeneity of fat saturation to determine whether parotid fat quantification was successful, with the success rate in the 114 subjects recorded for each protocol. In subjects whose fat quantification was successful with all three imaging methods, linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between any pair of the three parotid fat content measurement methods.


RESULTS
Success rates in parotid fat measurements by using T1, T2, and IDEAL methods were 87.7% (100 of 114), 87.7% (100 of 114), and 100% (114 of 114), respectively. The means of measured parotid fat contents revealed significant differences (P < .001) between any pair of the three measurement methods. The parotid fat contents measured with the three methods were significantly correlated with each other between any pair of combinations.


CONCLUSION
The IDEAL method provided a high success rate for parotid fat measurements, even in subjects with metallic dental implants."

Paper Title
Sofosbuvir‐based regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in severe renal dysfunction,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nonstructural 5B polymerase inhibitor with activity in all hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes and is the backbone of many anti‐HCV drug regimens. SOF is converted into inactive metabolites that undergo renal excretion. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 may experience increased drug exposure and thus potential toxicities along with decreased efficacy due to dose reduction or drug discontinuation. This is a single‐center study evaluating safety and effectiveness of SOF‐based regimens in patients with severe renal dysfunction, defined as eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2, including those receiving concurrent hemodialysis. Data were collected from patients with HCV and severe renal dysfunction who started full‐dose (400 mg) SOF‐based antiviral therapy ± ribavirin between April 2014 and February 2016. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, medical history, laboratory, radiologic imaging, echocardiography, transplant status, and liver pathologic findings. Twenty‐nine patients were identified; 12 had cirrhosis and 4 of those had decompensated cirrhosis. Fourteen patients had undergone transplantation of liver and/or kidney and were on calcineurin inhibitors, with 42% requiring dose increases or decreases while on therapy. All patients attained viral suppression on treatment, and 97% had a sustained viral response at 12 weeks posttreatment. There were no early treatment discontinuations. One death occurred posttreatment from a non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction in a patient with a history of coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: SOF‐based regimens appear safe in a broad range of patients with severe renal dysfunction, including those with decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplant. To confirm these retrospective findings, prospective studies that include SOF and SOF metabolite measurements coupled with prospective serial monitoring of electrocardiograms and echocardiograms are needed.

Paper Title
Environmental Enrichment and Health Outcomes Among Low-Grade Glioma Brain Tumor Survivors,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Brain tumor survivors who received radiotherapy (RT) are at a disproportionately increased risk of accelerated aging and symptom burden. We aim to examine the association between environmental enrichment (EE) and health outcomes among low-grade glioma survivors who received brain RT. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional cohort design, enrolling participants approximately 5 years from diagnosis. The construct of EE consisted of social network, physical activity, employment status, and financial stability. Berkman-Syme Social Network Index, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Vocational Index Scale, and a Socioeconomic Questionnaire were used to measure the construct of EE. Health outcome measures included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Symbol Digit Modality Test, clinical brain magnetic resonance images (pre-RT, approximately 2-3 years after RT, and approximately 5 years after RT), Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module. Ordinal logistic regression estimated the association between levels of EE and health outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-nine participants completed the study and experienced varying levels of EE. The median age was 44 years old, ranging from 26 to 78 years old. Nineteen individuals were diagnosed with oligodendroglioma, and 18 were diagnosed with astrocytoma. Thirteen participants had low EE, 17 had moderate EE, and 9 had high EE. Although not statistically significant, we observed patterns of increasing health outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Symbol Digit Modality Test, and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale) related to increasing levels of EE. CONCLUSION: This study is an initial exploration into the role of EE in health outcomes and survivorship programs for persons with glioma. Future research should assess EE before treatment or at the time of diagnosis and be longitudinal to accurately ascertain the association between EE and health outcomes. Comprehensive neuro-oncology survivorship programs structured to facilitate EE may reduce symptom burden, promote neuroplasticity, and improve cognitive and functional outcomes after brain radiation."

Paper Title
Environmental Enrichment After Primary Glioma Radiation Therapy.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVES
To explore and describe the health outcomes and levels of environmental enrichment (EE) in participants with brain tumors after radiation therapy (RT).


SAMPLE & SETTING
39 participants with glioma (grades 2-3) treated with RT were recruited within five years of original diagnosis from a neuro-oncology clinic.


METHODS & VARIABLES
A cross-sectional design was employed. EE measures included social connectedness, physical activity, employment, and financial stability. Health outcome measures included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, global cortical atrophy rate scale, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module. Descriptive statistics characterized the health outcomes between participants who received photon RT and proton beam RT.


RESULTS
Participants who received photon RT with high EE showed higher scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, and lower scores on the global cortical atrophy rate scale and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
EE may reduce symptom burden, promote healthy brain aging, and improve cognitive and functional status in glioma survivors receiving photon RT."

Paper Title
NCOG-01. VOCATIONAL STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH GLIOMA AT 5 YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"


Glioma (WHO grade 2-3) commonly affects adults, with a mean age at diagnosis of 41 years old. Given the demographic age of these brain tumor (BT) survivors, employment is the primary source of income, medical benefits, and financial stability. Unfortunately, job performance problems can occur at any time after diagnosis. This study aims to describe the vocational status and symptoms of these patients approximately five years following diagnosis.



The study employed a cross-sectional cohort design among persons with glioma treated with radiation approximately 5 years from the original diagnosis. Vocational-Independence Scale was used to ascertain employment status. Patients were asked about their experience returning to work after treatment. Symptoms were measured using the MDASI-BT Module.



Thirty-nine participants completed the study. The median age was 44 years old (range 26-78). Nineteen were diagnosed with oligodendroglioma, 18 with astrocytoma. Thirty-seven (95%) were working full-time at the time of diagnosis. Approximately five years following diagnosis, only 49% of participants are employed, working at least 15 hours per week (n=19). The remainder are unemployed (n=15, 39%), in a volunteer position (n=2, 5.1%), or working <15 hours per week (n=3, 7.7%). Interview data suggest those who are unemployed (n=9, 23%), retired early (n=2, 5%), or had reduced roles (n=11, 28%), were unable to return to prior roles due to symptoms they were experiencing 1-2 years after treatment. The frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (n=29, 74%), sleep disturbance (n = 24, 62%), distress (n = 25, 64%), drowsiness (n = 26, 67%), sadness (n = 25, 64%), issues with speaking (n = 25, 64%), short-term memory issues (n=35, 90%), and difficulty with concentration (n=20, 74%).



In addition to financial stability, employment is a valuable contributor to the quality of life, maintenance of identity, and physical and emotional health. Future research should examine and evaluate interventions that promote the return to work or engagement in the community.

Paper Title
NCOG-30. ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT AND HEALTH OUTCOMES AFTER RADIATION,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"
 Individuals treated with brain radiation (RT) are at a disproportionately increased risk of accelerated aging and symptom burden. The aim of this abstract is to describe the health outcomes experienced by brain tumor (BT) survivors who received Photon (XRT) and Proton-Beam (PBRT) in relation to levels of environmental enrichment (EE). The study employed a cross-sectional cohort design among persons with glioma (WHO Grade 2 and 3) treated with RT approximately 5 years following diagnosis. EE consists of social network/engagement, physical activity, and employment status/financial stability measured by the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Vocational Index Scale, and two Socioeconomic Questions, respectively. EE level is classified into low, moderate, or high tertile. Montreal Cognitive Assessment measured cognitive function. Cortical atrophy is measured using temporal brain MRI images from the time of diagnosis, 3 years after, and at the time of enrollment. Images were processed using FreeSurfer. MD Anderson Symptom Inventory – BT module was used to measure functional status. Two-Way ANOVA described the health outcomes among individuals who received XRT and PBRT. Thirty-nine participants, 18 with astrocytoma and 19 with oligodendroglioma, completed the study protocol. Eighteen individuals received XRT (5 were categorized into Low EE, 10 to Moderate EE and 3 had High levels of EE) and 21 received PBRT (8 were categorized into Low EE, 7 had Moderate EE and 6 had High EE). Individuals who received XRT and had High levels of EE had higher scores in MoCA, lower cortical atrophy rate, and lower symptom burden than individuals who had Moderate and Low EE. BT survivors are at an increased risk of accelerated aging and progressive neurological decline. Providing an enriched environment may serve to reduce symptom burden, promote healthy brain aging, and improve cognitive and functional status in BT survivors receiving radiation."

1138 Gender, Inflammation, and Cognition Affect the Sleep Trajectories of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Survivors,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"
 
 
 Sleep disturbance after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) impacts recovery and rehabilitation. Longitudinal studies examining trajectories of sleep are needed to understand patients’ experiences of sleep over time. We aimed to identify subgroups of SAH survivors based on distinct trajectories of sleep during the first 6 months post-SAH and determine whether they vary according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, inflammatory biomarkers (Toll-like receptor 4, Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha [TNF-α], Interleukin [IL]-1 beta, and IL-6), and symptoms-related characteristics (depression/anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, and cognition).
 
 
 
 We conducted a 6-month longitudinal study of 40 SAH survivors (average age: 56.9 years, 32.5% male). Multi-trajectory latent class growth analysis was used to identify salient patient groupings based on the trajectories of objective sleep parameters—sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST)—assessed using actigraphy at 2, 3, and 6 months. Sociodemographic, clinical, and symptom-related characteristics (at 2 months) and inflammatory biomarkers (at 2, 3, and 7 days and 2 months) were compared among trajectory groups using bivariate analyses. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.1.
 
 
 
 Two trajectory groups were identified: Group 1 (n = 24; “high SE/short SOL/short WASO/adequate TST”) and Group 2 (n = 16; “low SE/long SOL/long WASO/insufficient TST”). The mean scores of all sleep parameters remained stable across all three time points (2, 3, and 6 months) in both groups, except for SOL, which significantly decreased in Group 2, but remained higher than that of Group 1. Individuals in Group 1 (vs. Group 2) were more likely to be female and had lower plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 at days 3 and 7 post-SAH, respectively. Individuals in Group 1 (vs. Group 2) performed better in the following cognitive domains: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, attention, and delayed memory tasks at 2 months.
 
 
 
 Significant differences between the two trajectory groups were observed in gender proportion, TNF-α and IL-6 plasma levels, and cognitive domains. These findings may help healthcare providers identify patients at risk of developing sleep disturbances. Our study suggests inflammation as a plausible mechanism of sleep disturbances.

Paper Title
Associations Between 10-Year Physical Performance and Activities of Daily Living Trajectories and Physical Behaviors in Older Adults,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"Physical function is likely bidirectionally associated with physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep. We examined trajectories of physical function as predictors of these behaviors in community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 y without dementia from the Adult Changes in Thought cohort. Exposures were trajectories of physical performance (short Performance-Based Physical Function [sPPF]) and self-reported activities of daily living (ADL) impairment. Outcomes were device-measured PA and SB and self-reported sleep. We fit linear mixed-effects models to define trajectory slopes and intercepts for each functional measure over the prior 10 years. We used multivariable linear regression to investigate the relationship between trajectory features and outcomes, using bootstrap confidence intervals. Participants (N = 905) were 77.6 (SD = 6.9) years old, 55% female, 91% white, and had a median sPPF score of 9 (IQR = [8, 11]) and median impairment of 1 ADL (IQR = [0, 2]) at the time of activity measurement (baseline). Steeper decreases in sPPF (0.3-unit, 25% of the range) were associated with fewer steps (−1180, 95% CI = [−2853, −185]) and less moderate-to-vigorous PA (−15.7 min/day [−35.6, −2.3]). Steeper increases in ADL impairment were associated with 35.0 min/day (4.3, 65.0) additional sitting time, longer mean sitting bout duration (3.5 min/bout [0.8, 6.2]), fewer steps (−1372 [−2223, −638]), less moderate-to-vigorous PA (−13 min/day [−22.6, −5.0]), and more time-in-bed (25.5 min/day [6.5, 43.5]). No associations were observed with light PA or sleep quality. Worsening physical function is associated with lower PA and higher SB, but not with light-intensity movement or sleep quality, supporting the bidirectional nature of the relationship between physical function and physical behaviors."

Paper Title
1339 Assessing the Feasibility of a Multimodal Sleep Intervention for Community-dwelling Dyads of People Living with Dementia and Their Care Partners,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"


People living with dementia frequently experience sleep disturbances, and their informal care partners are also at high risk of poor sleep. Few sleep interventions consider the unique sleep interplay and challenges within caregiver-care-recipient dyads. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of co-designed multimodal intervention to address sleep disturbances in dyads of people living with dementia and their care partners in Australia and New Zealand.



Dyads of people living with dementia and their care partner were recruited from the community via social media and Dementia Support services. Eligible dyads completed the Dementia, Sleep and Wellbeing Program, a co-designed, six-week online sleep intervention. The program included a mix of group-based and personalised sessions, which combined Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia, mindfulness, activity, and light delivered by registered psychologists. Feasibility was evaluated by attrition, attendance, and satisfaction. Sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Sleep Disturbance Inventory. Psychological wellbeing was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-2. Feasibility outcomes were summarised using descriptive statistics, and sleep/mood outcomes were analysed using linear mixed models.



Twenty-three dyads were assessed for the study. Four dyads withdrew before the intervention, and one dyad withdrew during intervention, resulting in 18 dyads who completed the study (Mage=67.34 years, SDage=10.76). Attendance rates were high, with seven care partners attending all sessions. Both people living with dementia and care partners reported high satisfaction with the intervention. For care partners, significant reductions were observed in insomnia severity (p=.006) and improvements in sleep quality (p=.042). Significant improvements in insomnia severity (p=.006), depression (p=.002) and stress symptoms (p=.006) were observed for people living with dementia.



These findings provide support for a multimodal, dyadic approach to reducing sleep disturbances among community-dwelling people with dementia and their carer, demonstrating high engagement and satisfaction, and early indications of improved subjective sleep and wellbeing. These results highlight the potential efficacy of online interventions to address sleep issues in this population.

Integrating lived experience to develop a tailored sleep intervention for people living with dementia and carepartners,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Objectives Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and have adverse health consequences for both people living with dementia and their carepartners. Despite this, they are under-addressed caregiving settings. This study aimed to explore these sleep disturbances and co-design a multimodal sleep intervention for people living with dementia and their carepartners. Methods We conducted two focus groups and five semi-structured interviews (n = 4 people living with dementia, n = 6 carepartners). Active involvement of community advisors was sought throughout the design, development, and facilitation phases. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to explore sleep-related experiences and receive feedback to shape intervention development. Findings People living with dementia reported disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms, including sleep disturbances and confusion between day and night. Multiple sleep challenges were encountered by carepartners including insomnia, hypervigilance, and daytime impairment. The proposed sleep intervention was received positively, with significant insights emphasising the need for a multimodal toolkit approach, adaptation of the intervention across different dementia stages, and a focus on tailoring the program to carepartners. Conclusion Sleep interventions for caregivers and care-recipients should target both sleep and daytime functioning to ensure holistic support. Participants were receptive towards time-friendly, online, multimodal sleep interventions that combine cognitive behaviour therapies, light therapy, mindfulness, and exercise elements.","

Poor sleep and inflammatory gene expression among care partners of persons living with dementia: a pilot trial of a behavioral sleep intervention.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Objective
Poor sleep is associated with increased inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of chronic diseases and mortality. However, the effects of behavioral sleep interventions on the upstream inflammatory system are unknown among family care partners (CP). The present study explored the role of a behavioral sleep intervention program on inflammatory gene expression.


Methods
This was part of a randomized controlled trial of a sleep intervention for dementia care dyads with sleep problems. Thirty dyads were randomized to sleep intervention or control groups. Sleep outcomes for CP were assessed with 1 week of actigraphy and sleep diary, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Other information included CP demographics, body mass index, and intensity of caregiving tasks. All outcomes were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.


Results
Neither group showed any significant differential changes in gene expression from baseline to post-treatment or 3-month follow-up. A decrease in inflammatory gene expression was significantly associated with more nights of good sleep (i.e. nights without trouble falling or staying asleep at night). This finding remained significant after controlling for group (intervention/control), timepoint (baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up), and CP characteristics (e.g. age and ethnicity).


Conclusions
Although better sleep was associated with decreased inflammatory gene expression, this study did not demonstrate any benefits of a behavioral sleep intervention over control, most likely due to a small sample. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to test the specific aspects of disturbed sleep that relate to inflammatory biology among CP of persons living with dementia.","

Multi-modal sleep intervention for community-dwelling people living with dementia and primary caregiver dyads with sleep disturbance: protocol of a single-arm feasibility trial,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Disturbed sleep is common among people living with dementia and their informal caregivers, and is associated with negative health outcomes. Dyadic, multi-modal interventions targeting caregiver and care-recipient sleep have been recommended yet remain limited. This protocol details the development of a single-arm feasibility trial of a multi-modal, therapist-led, six-week intervention targeting sleep disturbance in dyads of people living with dementia and their primary caregiver. Methods We aim to recruit 24 co-residing, community-dwelling dyads of people living with dementia and their primary informal caregiver (n = 48) with sleep concerns (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ≥5 for caregivers, and caregiver-endorsed sleep concerns for the person living with dementia). People who live in residential care settings, are employed in night shift work, or are diagnosed with current, severe mental health conditions or narcolepsy, will be excluded. Participants will wear an actigraph and complete sleep diaries for two weeks prior, and during the last two weeks, of active intervention. The intervention is therapist-led and includes a mix of weekly small group video sessions and personalised, dyadic sessions (up to 90 min each) over six weeks. Sessions are supported by a 37-page workbook offering strategies and spaces for reflections/notes. Primary feasibility outcomes are caregiver: session attendance, attrition, and self-reported project satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include dyadic self-reported and objectively-assessed sleep, depression and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and social support. Self-report outcomes will be assessed at pre- and post-intervention. Discussion If feasible, this intervention could be tested in a larger randomised controlled trial to investigate its efficacy, and, upon further testing, may potentially represent a non-pharmacological approach to reduce sleep disturbance among people living with dementia and their caregivers.

Advancing Our Understanding of Engaging With Aging.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Our knowledge about healthy aging continues to evolve. To advance the fi eld, new paradigms need to be developed and tested that address the aging experience from the perspective of the person who is aging. Th e American Geriatrics Society challenged professionals to intensify educational, clinical, advocacy, and research eff orts that address healthy aging from a multidimensional perspective (Friedman et al., 2019). More specifi cally, a key area to further develop is person-centered approaches that address older adults’ goals, independence, functioning, resilience, dignity, and life satisfaction. Th e aim of this special issue is to advance our understanding of a process called Engaging With Aging (EWA). EWA is an active, conscious process taken on by an older adult or on behalf of the older adult (Primomo & Belza, 2019). Th is process involves coping with daily living and the aging process, placing an emphasis on active engagement to discover and test adaptations that help individuals maintain independence. Th e notion of EWA was fi rst put forth in a blog written for older adults and later advanced as a framework that can be used to study the processes of EWA. Th e EWA framework describes the nuances of how to engage with the impact of age-related changes, approaches to adapting and managing age-related changes, and challenges encountered. Authors of the articles in this EWA special issue represent varied specialties and roles in gerontology. Each article presents a diff erent perspective on the application of EWA. Carnevali, Primomo, and Belza (2019) describe the EWA framework, a perspective and set of processes older adults may use to manage daily living. Unlike other approaches to aging successfully, EWA was developed from the perspective of a nonagenarian, an insider to the aging process, as well as someone who is a theorist, scholar, and nurse. Carnevali refl ects on her own experience with normal age-related changes, the environment in which the age-related changes occur, the impact they have on function and lifestyle, and cognitive processes that can be used to identify ways to adapt and satisfactorily manage daily living tasks. Th e EWA framework provides a structure to examine the impact of age-related changes as well as older adults’ goals, resources, and adaptive capacities to"

Paper Title
Engaging With Aging: A Framework for Managing Daily Living.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Older adults live with the constant reality of having to manage their daily living with the emergence and progression of normal age-related changes that alter their usual capacities and resource needs. Although literature addresses successful aging, gaps exist in our understanding about how older adults manage daily living tasks, particularly from their viewpoint. To address this, the current authors propose Engaging with Aging (EWA), a perspective and set of processes older adults can use to approach daily living in a reasoned, purposeful manner that has similarities with clinical reasoning. EWA, a person-centered approach, can be considered citizen science in that it was developed by a nonagenarian based on personal experiences. Research using the EWA framework has the potential to advance the science of how older adults can manage and adapt to the impact of age-related changes to maintain independence and life satisfaction, and ultimately contribute to the development of care strategies.

Evaluation of a community-based outreach worker program for children with asthma.,

Year
2006,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
An asthma outreach worker (AOW) can provide home-based education about asthma management and methods to minimize home environmental asthma triggers. A theory-based AOW program was implemented by a community partnership and its effectiveness was evaluated.


DESIGN
Baseline and follow-up surveys were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the AOW.


SAMPLE
The convenience sample consisted of 60 caregivers whose children received AOW services.


MEASURES
Quality of life, use of asthma management plans, medication use, health care utilization, home environmental behavior changes to reduce triggers, and satisfaction with AOW services were self-reported by caregivers.


RESULTS
Caregivers reported significantly higher quality of life at follow-up than at baseline. At follow-up, 93% of the children had asthma management plans as compared with 31% at baseline. Self-reported hospitalizations were significantly reduced. All of the families made changes to minimize household asthma triggers. Caregivers reported high satisfaction with the AOW and 90% of them felt that the home environmental assessment conducted by the AOW helped improve their child's asthma.


CONCLUSION
Short-term community-based AOW services for children can be effective in enhancing self-management capabilities, improving the quality of life, increasing the use of asthma management plans, and helping families reduce asthma triggers in the home environment."

Association of Kidney Function With Incident Heart Failure: An Analysis of the Women's Health Initiative,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"Background Studies have shown an association of chronic kidney disease with heart failure (HF); however, this association has not been adequately examined in postmenopausal women, who are at heightened risk of both chronic kidney disease and HF. Additionally, association with HF subtypes is not well characterized. Methods and Results Incident HF was defined as first hospitalization for acute decompensated HF, obtained by self‐reported outcomes followed by physician adjudication through review of hospital records. Chronic kidney disease was defined using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Restricted cubic splines tested the association of eGFR with incident overall HF, and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF). Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated the multivariable‐adjusted association of eGFR categories with incident HF and its subtypes. The primary analysis included 23 309 women with 11 814 eGFR ≥90, 10 191 eGFR between 60 and 89, 1048 eGFR between 45 and 59 and 256 eGFR <45 mL/min per 1.73 m2. For overall HF, HFrEF and HFpEF, there was a stepwise increase in risk for incident HF with declining eGFR category. Associations were stronger for HFpEF (hazard ratio [HR], 2.80 [95% CI, 2.36–3.32]) than for HFrEF (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.66–2.87]) for eGFR <45 as compared with eGFR ≥90. Heterogeneity of the HF subdistributions (HFpEF versus HFrEF) was significant (P=0.017). Conclusions Kidney dysfunction is associated with incident HF in postmenopausal women. Although lower eGFR is associated with both incident HFrEF and HFpEF, the association is stronger with HFpEF. Registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT00000611."

Paper Title
Socioeconomic status and left ventricular ejection fraction decline in breast cancer survivors following receipt of doxorubicin (PREVENT WF-98213),

Year
2025,

Abstract
"Cancer survivors receiving doxorubicin may experience left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline during and following treatment; however, explanations for variations in decline beyond dosage differences, such as those related to socioeconomic status (SES), have not been fully examined. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 215 breast cancer survivors receiving doxorubicin. SES factors (e.g., household income, education) were collected via a survey at a baseline and EF was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Linear regression models showed that prior to treatment, no SES factors were associated with LVEF. However, six months following treatment, survivors who were unemployed for reasons other than retirement and disability experienced greater LVEF declines compared to survivors who were employed ((b = 2.79 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37–5.20; p = 0.026). Our study demonstrated that non-clinical factors associated with social drivers of health, such as socioeconomic status, contribute to subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction and therefore supports further investigation of mechanisms behind these associations. Trial registration NCT01988571 (WF-98213)."

Paper Title
Abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue associations with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"Abstract Background Obesity, classified by body mass index (BMI), is associated with higher postmenopausal breast cancer (BCa) risk. Yet, the associations between abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with BCa are unclear. Methods We assessed BCa associations with abdominal VAT and SAT in a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women without a history of cancer and with 27 years follow-up (N = 9950), during which all new cancers were adjudicated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans assessed adiposity at baseline, year 3, and year 6. Competing-risks multivariable sub-hazard ratios (SHR), with adjustments for sociodemographic, behavioral, reproductive, and anthropometric characteristics, were estimated for baseline and time-dependent associations between VAT, SAT, and incident BCa. Results Participants averaged 63.3 ± 7.4 years of age and a BMI of 28.20 ± 5.72 kg/m2 at baseline. The models included 738 incident BCa case patients (N = 593 invasive; N = 145 in situ). Baseline VAT and SAT area were associated with statistically significantly increased BCa risk, by 36% and 19%, respectively. Increasing VAT/SAT ratio was associated with an 8% increase in incident BCa. Time-dependent models produced similar results. VAT and VAT/SAT associated BCa risk was highest for African American/Black women, although not statistically significantly different from other groups. Quartiles (Q) of VAT/SAT were also explored; the SHR for Q4 compared with Q1 was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.18 to 1.87). Conclusion Higher abdominal VAT and SAT are associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal BCa, and VAT/SAT may provide a distinctive risk estimate. Potential racial and ethnic differences require replication in a larger sample (Women’s Health Initiative; NCT00000611; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00000611)."

Abstract 4145608: Calibration and Discrimination of Cardiovascular Risk Scores in Women with Breast Cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Women with breast cancer (BC) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Currently, there is no standardized approach to assess CVD risk in women with BC, despite recommendations for risk assessment. We estimated and compared the performance of established ASCVD risk scores (Framingham Risk Score [FRS], Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease [ASCVD] Risk Estimator, and Life’s Essential 8 [LE8]) in a cohort of postmenopausal women with BC.
 
 
 Methods:
 Women who were diagnosed with BC (stage I-III) and free of CVD from the Women‘s Health Initiative were included in this study. The primary outcome was 10-year risk of ASCVD, defined as a composite of adjudicated coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. For each risk score, we examined calibration and discrimination. Calibration was assessed by calculating bias, slope, standard error of the estimate (SEE), and root mean square deviation (RMSD). Discordance was defined as the percent difference between expected and observed events. Discrimination was evaluated using the c-statistic. We reassessed calibration and discrimination after recalibrating the FRS and ASCVD scores.
 
 
 Results:
 In 6,946 participants (mean age BC diagnosis: 70 years; 89.7% White), the 10-year incidence of ASCVD was 8.6%. FRS underestimated ASCVD risk by 31.1%, whereas ASCVD and LE8 scores overestimated the risk by 53.7% and 9.3%, respectively (Hosmer-Lemeshow P<0.001 for all scores) (Figure). Discordance was consistent throughout the risk continuum for FRS and ASCVD. However, for LE8, discordance was minimal for those at moderate- to high- risk and overestimated in those at low-risk. The ASCVD risk score had the highest c-statistic of 0.76, compared to 0.62 and 0.71 for the FRS and LE8, respectively (Figure). After recalibration, the discordance for FRS and ASCVD was reduced where the FRS overestimated the risk by 3.7% and the ASCVD overestimated the risk by 37.3%. There were no changes in c-statistics.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this analysis, LE8 had the best calibration, whereas ASCVD had the best discrimination. The ASCVD risk score had a c-statistic of 0.76, suggesting it may be a practical tool to aid in 10-year CVD risk stratification in women with BC.

Abstract 6296: Biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular dysfunction in cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction: Cancer survival has increased in part due to treatment advances. However, anthracycline chemotherapy increases cardiovascular (CV) morbidity risk, including atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). Among those receiving anthracyclines, it is yet unclear who is at greatest risk of ASCVD, a major cause of CV mortality. Elucidating pathophysiologic processes involved in the development ASCVD could shed light on strategies to identify those at risk.
 Methods: Analyses were performed on 279 lymphoma and breast cancer survivors enrolled in the PREVENT study [clinical trial WF-98213) through Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Base (NCORP) and Alliance (A221501)]. CV dysfunction was measured via cardiac MRI (cMRI) at baseline (pre-treatment) and 6-months post-diagnosis to ascertain aortic distensibility and wall thickness in the descending aorta. Biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6-months and were log-transformed to base 2. Multiple linear regression was used to determine associations between biomarker and outcome at 6 months, adjusted for baseline biomarker and cMRI outcome, age, race, sex, body mass index, and smoking history.
 Results: The mean age (SD) of cancer survivors 49 (12) years; 92% were women. The mean aortic distensibility and mean wall thickness at baseline was 0.002 (0.0014) and 2.99 (0.41), respectively. Table 1 shows the associations between biomarkers and aortic distensibility and wall thickness of the descending aorta. After adjustment for confounders, Arginine, CRP, MPO, and ornithine were associated with 6-month aortic distensibility, and the HDL and SDMA were associated with aortic wall thickness.
 Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that biomarkers in oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways may be involved in pathophysiology of ASCVD among cancer survivors receiving anthracyclines. These results require further study in larger cohorts to better define mechanistic pathways involved.

Paper Title
Effects of moderate/vigorous activity on 3-year body composition changes in postmenopausal women: a target trial emulation.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Background and Objective Postmenopausal women tend to experience significant changes in body composition, particularly abdominal adipose tissue (AAT) deposition patterns, which are hypothesized to be critical factors influencing future cardiometabolic disease risk. Physical activity has a demonstrable effect on body composition and overall health. However, there is little evidence for how different intensities and durations of physical activity over a sustained period of time influence AAT patterns and other measures of body composition in postmenopausal women. We emulated a target trial of physical activity interventions, including the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommendations, on 3-year changes in AAT and body composition. Methods We analyzed observational data from 4,451 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) to emulate a three-year target trial of adhering to increasing minutes of moderate (at least 15, 30, 75, 150, 300 minutes/week) and vigorous (at least 15, 30, 75, 150 minutes/week) physical activity aligned with the physical activity guidelines. All participants had repeated whole body Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans with derived abdominal visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The measured differences in average levels of VAT, SAT, and other body composition measures determined at end of follow-up were estimated with the parametric-g formula. Results Over 3 years, interventions of increasing minutes of moderate activity would result in dose-dependent reductions in abdominal VAT, SAT, and overall body fat, and increases in lean soft tissue, with the greatest estimated benefit at the 2018 physical activity guideline recommendation of 150 mins/wk or more. Compared to no intervention, if all participants had adhered to at least 150 mins/wk of moderate physical activity, they would have 16.8 cm2 lower VAT (95% CI -23.1, -10.4), 26.8 cm2 lower SAT (95% CI -36.3, -17.3), 1.3% lower total body fat% (95% CI -1.8, -0.7), 1.2 % higher total lean soft tissue% (95% CI 0.7, 1.8), and 2.6 kg lower total bodyweight (95% CI -3.6, -1.5). We saw similar patterns in our vigorous-intensity activity interventions - if all participants adhered to at least 150 mins/wk, they would have experienced 6.7 cm2 lower VAT (95% CI -17.7, 4.3), 13.3 cm2 lower SAT (95% CI -28.8, 2.1), 1.0 % lower total body fat percent (95% CI -2.0, 0.0 ), % higher total lean soft tissue percent (95% CI) and a 0.9 kg lower total bodyweight (95% CI -2.7, 0.8). Conclusion This hypothetical emulated intervention indicated that postmenopausal women who adhere to physical activity guideline recommendations would experience beneficial changes in abdominal VAT, SAT, and overall body composition over 3 years. The study results underscore the imperative to explore further how physical activity may serve as a potential determinant of body composition."

Paper Title
The relationship between body composition and left ventricular performance in women with breast, lymphoma, or sarcoma cancer,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Background To understand how body composition in those with elevated body mass index impacts left ventricular function decline during cancer treatment, we determined the association between baseline body mass index (BMI), intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) with baseline to 3-month left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) change among women receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer, lymphoma, or sarcoma. Methods Women underwent potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab, for treatment of breast cancer, lymphoma, or sarcoma. We obtained magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of body composition and cardiac function prior to treatment, and then a repeat MRI for cardiac function assessment at three months into treatment. Analyses and assessment of abdominal adipose tissue volumes and LVEF outcomes were conducted by independent reviewers blinded to all patient identifiers. A general linear model was created to examine associations between adipose tissue depots, BMI, and 3-month LVEF change. Results Women (n = 210) aged 56 ± 11 years with breast cancer, lymphoma, and sarcoma were enrolled (n = 195, 14, 1 respectively). Baseline BMI, IAT, and SAT fat were independently associated with 3-month LVEF declines (p = 0.001 to 0.025 for all). After adjusting for baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors, BMI, IAT, and SAT, BMI remained the only variable associated with 3-month LVEF decline (p = 0.047). Conclusions These results suggest that factors other than abdominal adipose tissue or traditional cardiovascular risk factors may contribute to 3-month declines in LVEF among women with elevated BMI receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Further investigation should be conducted on psychosocial stress, physical activity, sleep, or diet. Trial registration DETECTIV_NCT01719562, WF99112, & WF97415—NCT02791581."

Paper Title
The relationship between cardiometabolic abnormalities and mortality among women with and without cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"e24007 Background: Prior studies of women with obesity-associated cancers in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) showed higher overall and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) for women with a higher number of cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline. It is unclear if this risk differs from women without cancer. In order to determine if this relationship differs among both groups, we compared the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality among women in the WHI with and without cancer. Methods: Women with one of five early-stage obesity-associated cancers (breast, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and matched controls without history of cancer, were selected from the WHI-Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC) study. Cardiometabolic risk factors included high waist circumference (WC) (≥88 cm), systemic hypertension ( > 130/85 mm Hg) measured at study visits, and self-reported history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (all-cause mortality) and Fine-Gray models (CVD and non-CVD mortality) were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate the association between baseline cardiometabolic risk factors and survival outcomes for the cancer and non-cancer cohorts in separate models. Sensitivity analyses included women in the cancer-cohort who received cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Results: A total of 7,491 and 35,508 women were analyzed in the cancer and non-cancer cohorts respectively. CVD was the most common cause of death (excluding cancer) in both non-cancer (41.4%) and cancer (41.5%) cohorts. Adjusted Cox models showed that the proportion of deaths due to any cause, by number of cardiometabolic risk factors, was significantly higher in the non-cancer compared to the cancer cohort (p-value = 0.02), with the HR values being higher for those with 3-4 risk factors compared to 1-2. Similar results were seen for each individual risk factor except for WC. Regarding CVD and non-CVD mortality, in competing risks models, there were no significant differences in the risk of death by number of risk factors, between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts (p = 0.21 and 0.22) respectively. Sensitivity analyses for women who received a cardiotoxic regimen, (81.5% anthracyclines alone, 13.4% anti-HER2 alone, and 5.1% both) showed no differences in the results for all-cause mortality, and CVD mortality. However, for non-CVD mortality, the proportion of deaths was significantly higher for women in the non-cancer cohort (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Cardiometabolic risk factors had a greater impact on mortality among women without cancer compared to those with cancer, except for death due to CVD which was similar between groups, suggesting that CVD risk reducing interventions are of equal importance for women with and without cancer."

Paper Title
Health promotion after hematopoietic cell transplant: Barriers to survivor revaccination.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 358
 
 
 Background:
 Comprehensive hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivorship care includes revaccination (RV) to restore immunity to vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). No published studies have reported the barriers or facilitators to complete RV. Since HCT survivors are at higher risk for infectious morbidity and mortality, it is imperative to understand RV complexity to better inform health promotion measures.
 Methods:
 A mixed methods, cross-sectional approach was selected to study US adults surviving 2-8 years post-HCT at a major transplant center using a de novo survey. Prevalence of vaccine confidence (VC) levels were determined with descriptive statistics. Relationships were explored between VC and RV outcomes (or intentions) using Fisher’s exact test and between VC and predictors using logistic regression. Open-ended VC responses about constructs (benefits, trust, harms) were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Prevalence of other barriers/facilitators were determined, along with their association with RV outcomes using logistic regression and relationships between most frequent barriers (or facilitators) and RV outcomes using Fisher’s exact test. Open-ended barrier/facilitator responses were analyzed using deductive content analysis and the
 WHO behavioral and social drivers of vaccination framework.
 Results:
 Of 332 participants, 69% reported high, 20% medium, and 11% low VC. RV intent (p<.001) and outcomes (p=.04) correlated with VC. Multiple factors were associated with high VC. Merged analysis created a narrative about the relative importance of VC constructs: the low VC group relayed (dis)trust>harms>benefits, the medium VC group relayed trust>benefits~harm, and the high VC group relayed benefits>trust>harm. Among five most-reported RV barriers, two (on immunosuppression [p=.001], insufficient immune recovery [p<.001]) were associated with no or partial RV. Among five most-reported RV facilitators, three (having a clear vaccine calendar [p=.032], being able to contact HCT center about vaccine question [p=.018], getting vaccines at HCT center [p=.04]) were associated with complete RV. With each additional reported barrier, the odds of being completely revaccinated were lower (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46-0.72, p<.001), and with each additional reported facilitator, the odds of being completely revaccinated were higher (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.05-1.63, p<.001). Content analysis suggested that most barriers were practical issues (e.g. clear calendar of which vaccines when, insurance coverage). Overall, barriers outweighed facilitators in the no and partial RV groups whereas facilitators outweighed barriers in the complete RV group.
 Conclusions:
 Only 69% of survivors had high VC which significantly affected RV intent and outcome, as did practical barriers and facilitators.These findings expand our knowledge about factors influencing RV in US HCT survivors and could inform future RV standards, policies, and research on testing interventions to improve RV uptake.

Paper Title
Low physical function Post-Cancer diagnosis is associated with higher mortality risk in postmenopausal women.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Postmenopausal women with cancer experience an accelerated physical dysfunction beyond that expected through aging alone due to cancer and its treatments. The aim of this study is to determine whether declines in physical function after cancer diagnosis are associated with all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality.


METHODS
This prospective cohort study included 8,068 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) who were diagnosed with cancer and had physical function assessed within 1-year of cancer diagnosis. Self-reported physical function was measured using the 10-item physical function subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Cause of death was determined by medical record review with central adjudication and linkage to the National Death Index. Death was adjudicated through February 2022.


RESULTS
Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years from cancer diagnosis 3,316 (41.1%) women died. Our results showed that for every 10% decline in the physical function score after cancer diagnosis, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were significantly reduced by 12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.86 to 0.91), respectively. Further categorical analyses showed a significant dose-response relationship between post-diagnosis physical function categories and mortality outcomes (trend test P < .001), where the median survival time for women in the lowest physical function quartile was 9.1 (8.6, 10.6) years compared to 18.4 (15.8, 22.0) years for women in the highest physical function quartile.


CONCLUSION
Postmenopausal women with low physical function after cancer diagnosis may be at higher risk of mortality from all causes and cancer-related mortality."

Paper Title
Estimating burden of cardiovascular disease among survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer in the detroit research on cancer survivors (ROCS) cohort.,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"12082 Background: With new advances in cancer treatment, cancer-specific mortality has decreased by 31% over the past 3 decades. The growing number of cancer survivors has led to increased risk of other chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has become an important competing cause of mortality. This study evaluates the incidence of CVD, including heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke after cancer in the Detroit ROCS cohort. Methods: ROCS is an African American cancer survivorship cohort that enrolled participants residing in the tri-county Detroit Metropolitan area. This study included survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer who provided socio-demographic and clinic information on self-administered questionnaires. We calculated incidence as percentages and rates per 1,000 person-years of HF, MI, CAD, AF, and stroke after cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between socio-demographic and clinical predictors of CVD by using factors with p-value < 0.1. Results: After excluding patients with pre-existing CVD or lack of data on comorbidities, the study cohort consisted of 2,865 participants. The mean (SD) age at cancer diagnosis was 60.3 (9.4) years with median follow up of 3.0 (1.0-9.3) years. The incidence rate for any CVD was 23.3 per 1,000 person-years. In the study sample, stroke was the leading CVD, followed by HF, AF, CAD and MI. Lung cancer survivors had the highest incidence of CVD followed by prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer. Age at cancer diagnosis, household income, insurance, aspirin, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol were included in the final model. In the multivariate analysis, decreased household income [OR 1.26 (95% CI 1.05-1.52)], prior aspirin use [OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.34-2.49)], and history of hypertension [OR 1.71 (95% CI 1.20-2.44)] were associated with higher odds of CVD. Conclusions: CVD is a relatively common outcome within years after cancer diagnosis in an African American survivorship cohort. Intervention should focus on the possible impact of socioeconomic variables and control of hypertension in reducing the risk of CVD after cancer. [Table: see text]"

Paper Title
Factors associated with long-term gastrointestinal toxicity in colorectal cancer survivors in the women’s health initiatives (WHI) study.,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"e24057 Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors often experience long-term symptom toxicity after cancer treatments. We described persistent gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity related to cancer and treatments in long-term CRC survivors and assessed the risk and life impact factors of GI toxicity. Methods: A cross-sectional study utilized data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC) study that recruited postmenopausal women. CRC survivors after cancer treatments were included (N = 413). Pearson correlations/A Chi-square test and multivariable linear regression models were used to identify risk and impact factors of GI toxicity. Results: 81% of CRC survivors experienced persistent GI toxicity. Bloating/gas was the most prevalent (54.2%) and severe, followed by constipation (34.1%), diarrhea (33.4%), and abdominal/pelvic pain (28.6%). Time since cancer diagnosis (< 5 years), advanced cancer stage, low income, high psychological distress, poor dietary habits and physical activity, and impaired life impact measures (health-related quality of life, daily life interferences, and body image) were significantly associated with several GI toxicities. Fatigue and sleep disturbance were the most significantly associated with long-term GI toxicity (Table 1). Abdominal/pelvic pain significantly influenced life impact measures. Conclusions: GI toxicities are highly prevalent among CRC survivors, specifically in patients with high psychological distress. A better understanding of the long-term GI toxicity in CRC survivors and identifying those more vulnerable may inform future directions for managing CRC survivorship. An individualized, multifaceted intervention is warranted to consider psychosocial support, lifestyle intervention, and physical rehabilitation. [Table: see text]"

Abstract B014: Income level associated with death from cardiovascular disease after breast cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"
 Introduction: Breast cancer (BC) treatment has known cardiotoxic effects. While increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) after BC has been demonstrated in select racial/ethnic minorities, less is known about the association of social determinants of health (SDH) variables on death from CVD after BC treatment. Methods: Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative, we examined factors associated with increased risk of death from CVD after BC diagnosis among 8,728 women (n=7,433 non-Hispanic White (NHW); n=706 non-Hispanic, Black (NHB); n=288 Hispanic, n=271 non-Hispanic Asian; n=30 missing racial information) . Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between survival outcomes (death due to BC, death due to CVD, and adjudicated CVD after BC) and race/ethnicity and income. Income level was stratified into less than $35,000, $35,000-$74,999, and greater than or equal to $75,000. Results: Income level less than $35,000 was associated with a significantly increased risk of death due to CVD after BC (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.84) compared to income between $35,000 and $74,999. Income greater than $75,000 was associated with a significantly less risk of death due to CVD after BC (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.71).  A higher cumulative incidence of death from BC and death from CVD was associated with the lowest income bracket. Furthermore, death from CVD surpassed death from BC around 13 years after BC diagnosis for income levels less than $35,000 and at 20 years after BC diagnosis for those with income levels between $35,000 and $74.999. However, for the highest income bracket of greater than $75,000, death from CVD never surpassed cumulative incidence of death from BC. Hispanic women were less likely to have death due to CVD after BC compared to NHW women (HR=0.10; 95% CI:0.49,0.77). No significant difference in death from CVD was seen between NHW and NHB women. Among NHW women, those with income less than $35,000 had higher likelihood of death from CVD (HR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.84), compared to those with income between $35,000 and $74,999. NHW women with greater than $75,000 had a less likely chance of dying compared to those with income between $35,000 and $74,999 (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77). A difference in death due to CVD across income levels was not observed among NHB women. However, among Hispanic women with less than $35,000 annual income, a 10- fold increased risk of death from CVD was observed compared to Hispanic women with annual income $35,000-$74,999 (HR=10.41; 95% CI 1.43, 75.57). Conclusion: In the WHI, income level was strongly associated with increased risk of death from CVD after BC, especially among NHW and Hispanic women, but not among NHB women. Clinical trials investigating therapies with potential cardiotoxic effects must include patients with diverse income levels to prevent potentially exacerbating BC disparities.

Paper Title
Abstract 16393: Incident Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Breast Cancer Patients Stratified by Race and Ethnicity,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"
 Background:
 The development of incident cardiometabolic risk factors in racial and ethnic minority groups of women with breast cancer (BC) has not been well-characterized.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 We expect a higher risk of incident cardiometabolic risk factors [hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), dyslipidemia] in racial and ethnic minority women with BC without a history of these conditions compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) women with BC.
 
 
 Methods:
 The Pathways Heart Study is a prospective cohort study of women with invasive BC diagnosed from 2005 to 2013 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Cumulative incidence rates of incident HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia determined from the electronic health record (using two separate ICD 9/10 codes in the 2 years prior to BC diagnosis, lab values, and medication dispensings) were calculated using a competing risk framework for overall death. Sub-distribution hazard ratios for incident HTN, DM, and dyslipidemia were estimated using Fine and Gray proportional hazards regression, adjusted for
 a priori
 identified covariables, and stratified by race and ethnicity.
 
 
 Results:
 A total of 14,942 women with BC had mean age 61.2 years and were 65% NHW, 7.5% Black, 14.4% Asian, 11.9% Hispanic, 0.4% Pacific Islander, and 0.8% American Indian/Alaska Native. Compared to NHW women, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander women had higher risk of incident DM (Table 1). Black and Asian women had higher risk of incident HTN compared with NHW women. Asian women had higher risk of incident dyslipidemia compared with NHW women.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Racially and/or ethnically diverse women with BC experienced higher risk of incident DM, HTN, and dyslipidemia compared with NHW women with BC. Asian women consistently had a higher risk of each cardiometabolic risk factor. It is critical to better characterize health disparities in the field of cardio-oncology to inform future cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment strategies.

Paper Title
Long-term Trajectories of Physical Function Decline in Women With and Without Cancer.,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Importance
Patients with cancer experience acute declines in physical function, hypothesized to reflect accelerated aging driven by cancer-related symptoms and effects of cancer therapies. No study has examined long-term trajectories of physical function by cancer site, stage, or treatment compared with cancer-free controls.


Objective
Examine trajectories of physical function a decade before and after cancer diagnosis among older survivors and cancer-free controls.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This prospective cohort study enrolled patients from 1993 to 1998 and followed up until December 2020. The Women's Health Initiative, a diverse cohort of postmenopausal women, included 9203 incident cancers (5989 breast, 1352 colorectal, 960 endometrial, and 902 lung) matched to up to 5 controls (n = 45 358) on age/year of enrollment and study arm.


Exposures
Cancer diagnosis (site, stage, and treatment) via Medicare and medical records.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Trajectories of self-reported physical function (RAND Short Form 36 [RAND-36] scale; range: 0-100, higher scores indicate superior physical function) estimated from linear mixed effects models with slope changes at diagnosis and 1-year after diagnosis.


Results
This study included 9203 women with cancer and 45 358 matched controls. For the women with cancer, the mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 73.0 (7.6) years. Prediagnosis, physical function declines of survivors with local cancers were similar to controls; after diagnosis, survivors experienced accelerated declines relative to controls, whose scores declined 1 to 2 points per year. Short-term declines in the year following diagnosis were most severe in women with regional disease (eg, -5.3 [95% CI, -6.4 to -4.3] points per year in regional vs -2.8 [95% CI, -3.4 to -2.3] for local breast cancer) or who received systemic therapy (eg, for local endometrial cancer, -7.9 [95% CI, -12.2 to -3.6] points per year with any chemotherapy; -3.1 [95% CI, -6.0 to -0.3] with radiation therapy alone; and -2.6 [95% CI, -4.2 to -1.0] with neither, respectively). While rates of physical function decline slowed in the later postdiagnosis period (eg, women with regional colorectal cancer declined -4.3 [95% CI, -5.9 to -2.6] points per year in the year following diagnosis vs -1.4 [95% CI, -1.7 to -1.0] points per year in the decade thereafter), survivors had estimated physical function significantly below that of age-matched controls 5 years after diagnosis.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this prospective cohort study, survivors of cancer experienced accelerated declines in physical function after diagnosis, and physical function remained below that of age-matched controls even years later. Patients with cancer may benefit from supportive interventions to preserve physical functioning."

Paper Title
A review of research on the intersection between breast cancer and cardiovascular research in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI),

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Both obesity and metabolic syndrome are linked to increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers of the breast (post-menopausal), and other obesity-related cancers. Over the past 50 years, the worldwide prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome has increased, with a concomitant higher incidence of associated co-morbidities and mortality. The precise mechanism linking metabolic syndrome to increased cancer incidence is incompletely understood, however, individual components of metabolic syndrome have been linked to increased breast cancer incidence and worse survival. There is a bidirectional relationship between the risk of CVD and cancer due to a high burden of shared risk factors and higher rates of CVD among cancer survivors, which may be impacted by the pro-inflammatory microenvironment associated with metabolic syndrome and cancer-directed therapies. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) is an excellent resource to study a dual relationship between cancer and CVD (cardio-oncology) with extensive information on risk factors and long-term outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of research on cardio-oncology conducted utilizing WHI data with focus on studies evaluating both breast cancer and CVD including shared risk factors and outcomes after cancer. The review also includes results on other obesity related cancers which were included in the analyses of breast cancer, articles looking at cancer after heart disease (reverse cardio-oncology) and the role of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) as a shared risk factor between CVD and cancer. A summary of pertinent WHI literature helps to delineate the direction of future research evaluating the relationship between CVD and other cancer sites, and provides information on the opportunity for other novel analyses within the WHI."

Paper Title
Associations of Health-Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance With Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Breast cancer (BC) survivors are at an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD), often attributed to cancer treatment. However, cancer treatment may also negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a risk factor of CVD in the general population. Objective We examined whether sleep disturbance, and physical or mental HRQoL were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative of postmenopausal women given a diagnosis of invasive BC during follow-up through 2010 with no history of CVD before BC. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke, after BC. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the Short-Form 36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and sleep disturbance, measured by the Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, were recorded post BC. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring and adjusted for relevant confounders. Results In 2884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher Physical Component Summary scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.99]; per 5-point increment in Physical Component Summary). No associations with CVD were found for Mental Component Summary or Insomnia Rating Scale. Conclusion In BC survivors, poor physical HRQoL is a significant predictor of CVD. Implications for Practice Our findings highlight the importance for nurses to assess and promote physical HRQoL as part of a holistic approach to mitigating the risk of CVD in BC survivors."

Paper Title
Statins and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Following Doxorubicin Treatment.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Statins taken for cardiovascular indications by patients with breast cancer and lymphoma during doxorubicin treatment may attenuate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline, but the effect of statins on LVEF among patients with no cardiovascular indications is unknown.


METHODS
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-month randomized trial of 40 mg of atorvastatin per day administered to patients with breast cancer and lymphoma receiving doxorubicin was conducted within the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program across 31 sites in the United States. At pretreatment and then 6 and 24 months after initiating doxorubicin, we assessed left ventricular (LV) volumes, strain, mass, and LVEF through cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, along with cognitive function and serum markers of inflammation. The primary outcome was the difference in 24-month LVEF between placebo and treatment groups, adjusted for pretreatment LVEF.


RESULTS
A total of 279 participants were enrolled in the trial. Participants had a mean (±SD) age of 49±12 years; 92% were women; and 83% were White. The mean (±SD) LVEF values were 61.7±5.5% before treatment and 57.4±6.8% at 24 months in the placebo group and 62.6±6.4% before treatment and 57.7±5.6% at 24 months in the atorvastatin group. On the basis of a multiple imputed data set for missing data and adjusted for each individual's pretreatment LVEF, 24-month declines in LVEF averaged 3.3±0.6 percentage points and 3.2±0.7 percentage points, for those randomly assigned to placebo versus statins, respectively (P=0.93). Across both treatment arms, similar percentages of individuals experienced changes of more than 10 percentage points in LVEF, LV strain, LV mass, cognition, and inflammation biomarkers, including among those with greater than 90% drug compliance.


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with breast cancer and lymphoma with no existing indication for statin therapy, prospective statin administration did not affect LVEF declines 2 years after doxorubicin. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01988571.)."

Paper Title
LVEF decline in relation to body composition among women treated for breast cancer: WF-97415.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"10556 Background: Despite an improvement in survival from breast cancer (BC), many women experience cardiotoxicity. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced by an average of 9.7% in women receiving anthracyclines. Obesity and central adiposity at BC diagnosis may influence risk of LVEF decline. We sought to examine associations between body composition and LVEF decline in the UPBEAT (Understanding and Predicting Fatigue, Cardiovascular Decline, and Events After Breast Cancer: WF-97415) study, which was conducted in collaboration with NCI Community Oncology Research Program. Methods: The analytic cohort was comprised of 167 women treated for stage I-III BC with chemotherapy and/or radiation in the UPBEAT prospective study, in whom LVEF was obtained at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months. Linear regression was used to examine LVEF decline in relation to 1) waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and 2) changes in WC and BMI during BC treatment. All models were adjusted for age and race. Results: In this cohort (mean [SD] age: 55.7 [10.8] yrs; in whom 75% were white; 19% were Black), the mean (SD) LVEF at baseline was 60.7 (6.7)% with a mean decline of 2.7 (7.2)% from baseline to 3-months. Both WC and BMI at BC diagnosis were associated with LVEF decline during follow-up (Table). For each additional inch in WC, EF decreased by 0.25% points at 3 months (P=0.024); for each additional kg/m2 in BMI, EF decreased by 0.2% points at 3 months (P=0.007). Reduced BMI during treatment was associated with LVEF decline, whereas a change in WC was not. Each kg/m2 reduction in BMI was associated with a 0.4% point decrease in LVEF (p=0.037). Anthracycline use was associated with a 1.89% point decline in LVEF at 3 months versus non-users (p=0.049). After additional adjustment for anthracycline use, baseline WC remained statistically significantly associated with LVEF decline to the same degree. Conclusions: These data show that central adiposity at BC diagnosis is associated with LVEF decline during treatment, even after controlling for anthracyclines. Loss of central adiposity was not associated with LVEF decline, whereas BMI loss during treatment was. This suggests that shifts in body composition during BC treatment, potentially via loss of muscle mass, are important to monitor in patients. Future work should examine how changes in body composition, particularly changes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue depots, influence cardiac dysfunction in BC patients during treatment.

Paper Title
Abstract 15290: Hypertension in Black and White Breast Cancer Survivors: NCT02992730,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Hypertension (HTN) may increase the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events among breast cancer (BC) survivors, particularly in Black women. Limited information is available about factors associated with the presence of HTN at the time of BC diagnosis among Black versus White women.
 
 
 Methods:
 In a secondary analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort of Black and White women diagnosed with hormone receptor positive (HR+) BC, post initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), medical records were used to determine HTN status and other clinical factors (stage, AET type, CV comorbidities). In the same cohort, psychosocial and quality of life data were collected via surveys. Logistic regression models evaluated factors associated with increased odds of HTN at baseline.
 
 
 Results:
 Women with BC (n=243) were mostly White (66.7%), mean (SD) aged 61.6 (10.9) years, with borderline obesity (BMI: 29.9 (6.6)). Comorbidities and tamoxifen use were reported by 40.7% and 28.4% of women, respectively. HTN was present in 140 (57.6%) women (38% Black, 62% White). Relative to their White counterparts, Black women with HTN were significantly younger, (61.5 vs. 67.5 years of age,
 p<
 0.01) more overweight (BMI, 32.8 vs 29.3,
 p
 =<.01), received chemotherapy more frequently (44.4% vs 22.1%,
 p
 <0.01), were more likely to have experienced discrimination (35.2% vs 7%,
 p
 <0.01) and more often to possess CV comorbidities (61.1% vs 37.2%,
 p
 <0.01). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of having HTN increased significantly with age by 10% per year (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06-1.14; p<.0001), with Black women having a 2-fold greater risk of having HTN (OR: 2.02, 1.02-4.03; p=.044) than White women. Additionally, a 1-unit increase in BMI was associated with 6% higher odds of having HTN (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11; p=0.0390) while Tamoxifen use, presence of CV comorbidities and worse social well-being were not associated with more frequent HTN in women with BC.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 A high proportion of women diagnosed with HR+ BC have HTN with Black vs White women experiencing more HTN. These results raise the possibility that Black women with BC may benefit from focused HTN management strategies to reduce potential CV events.

Paper Title
Abstract 15439: Longitudinal Assessment of Racial Differences in Exercise Capacity After Breast Cancer Treatment: WF-97415,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Breast cancer (BC) treatment toxicity contributes to elevated rates of cardiovascular morbidities, such as reduced exercise capacity, a risk factor for long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Past studies have shown that Black women experience greater cardiotoxicity after BC treatment than white women. No studies have investigated racial differences in exercise capacity. The lack of longitudinal data leaves uncertainty as to whether greater declines in exercise capacity are experienced by Black BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 This cohort was comprised of 236 women with stage I-III BC (80% white; 20% Black) and 130 cancer-free controls in the UPBEAT (NCT02791581) and DETECT (NCT01719562) studies. Submaximal exercise capacity was obtained via 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD, meters [m]) at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months. Linear regression was used to examine associations of race with baseline 6MWD and changes in 6MWD.
 
 
 Results:
 Mean age [SD] of BC survivors was 55.7 [10.9] years. Mean [SD] total meters walked pre-treatment was lower in Black women with BC (423 m [81.0]) than white women with BC (475 m [87.7]; p=0.01), and lower than Black women without BC (471 m [76.9]; p=0.07). Black BC survivors experienced a greater mean decline from baseline to 3-months in 6MWD (30 m [68.5]) than white BC survivors (21.7 m [86.6]; Table 1; p=0.02) or Black women without BC (9.2 m [67.3]; p=0.001), translating to a mean difference of 60 m between Black and white BC survivors during BC treatment.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 This is the first study to suggest racial differences in submaximal exercise capacity during BC treatment. Black BC survivors experienced a greater reduction in exercise capacity than white BC survivors after cancer treatment as early as 3-months post-diagnosis. This clinically-meaningful difference in exercise capacity warrants further investigation, particularly to determine interventions to reverse the loss of exercise capacity.

Paper Title
Changes in Physical Activity, Functional Capacity, and Cardiac Function during Breast Cancer Therapy.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"PURPOSE
Functional capacity and cardiac function can decline during breast cancer (BC) therapy. In non-cancer populations, higher physical activity (PA) is associated with better physical function and cardiac health. This study compared baseline PA, functional capacity, and cardiac function between women with and without BC and tested if greater PA participation was related to higher functional capacity and/or better heart function after three months of BC therapy.


METHODS
Data was collected in 104 women without BC (82% Caucasian, baseline only) and 110 women with stage I-III BC (82% Caucasian) before therapy and after three months of treatment. Participants self-reported PA and underwent six-minute walk distance (6MWD) testing to measure functional capacity and cardiovascular magnetic resonance to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Analyses were adjusted for age, race, body mass index (BMI), and medication use.


RESULTS
The BC group was older (56.2 ± 10.7 vs 52.1 ± 14.7 yrs, P=0.02) with a higher average BMI than the non-cancer group (30.3 ± 6.8 vs 27.7 ± 6.2 kg/m2, P<0.01). Pre-treatment, BC participants reported lower PA scores (27.9 ± 2.8 vs 34.9 ± 2.8, P=0.04) with similar 6MWD and LVEF relative to those without cancer (485 ± 11 vs 496 ± 11 m, P=0.4 and 59.7 ± 0.7 vs 58.9 ± 0.8%, P=0.37, respectively). After three months of BC therapy, declines were observed for PA scores (27.9 ± 2.8 vs 18.3 ± 2.5, P=0.02), 6MWD (485 ± 11 vs 428 ± 10 m, P<0.001), and LVEF (59.7 ± 0.7 vs 56.1 ± 0.7%, P<0.001). Compared to BC participants who reported no PA at three months (n=24, 22%), BC women who reported any PA (n=78, 86%) had higher 6MWD (442 ± 11 vs 389 ± 17 m, P=0.006) but similar LVEF (56.5 ± 0.9 vs 55.3 ± 1.5%, p=0.5). Women who reported any PA were less likely to exhibit an LVEF below normal (<50%) or decline in LVEF of 'â•10 points compared to inactive women (BMI-adjusted, OR [95% CI]: 0.27 [0.09, 0.85]).


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary results indicate that self-reported PA, LVEF and 6MWD decline in the first three months of BC treatment, but PA participation during BC treatment may mitigate declines in functional capacity and cardiac function. Further research is needed to identify barriers and facilitators of PA participation during BC therapy.

Paper Title
Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists and Heart Failure Risk in Postmenopausal Women: The Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Prior studies suggested lower risk of heart failure (HF) in individuals taking H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) compared with H2RA nonusers in relatively small studies. We evaluated the association of H2RA use and incident HF in postmenopausal women in the large‐scale WHI (Women’s Health Initiative) study. Methods and Results This study included postmenopausal women from the WHI without a history of HF at baseline. HF was defined as first incident hospitalization for HF and physician adjudicated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated the association of H2RA use as a time‐varying exposure with HF risk, after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and medical history variables. Sensitivity analyses examined (1) risk of HF stratified by the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) score, (2) propensity score matching on H2RA use, (3) use of proton pump inhibitors rather than H2RA nonuse as the referent, and (4) exclusion of those taking diuretics at baseline. The primary analysis included 158 854 women after exclusion criteria, of whom 9757 (6.1%) were H2RA users. During median 8.2 years of follow‐up, 376 H2RA users (4.9 events/1000 person‐years) and 3206 nonusers (2.7 events/1000 person‐years) developed incident HF. After multivariable adjustment, there was no association between H2RA use and HF in the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94–1.22; P=0.31) or in any of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Clinical H2RA use was not associated with incident HF among postmenopausal women. Future studies are needed to evaluate potential effect modification by sex, HF severity, or patterns of use on H2RA exposure and HF risk.

Paper Title
Inflammatory, Oxidative Stress, and Cardiac Damage Biomarkers and Radiation-Induced Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Purpose Studies examining biomarkers associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation are limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-breast cancer fatigue in survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine, myeloperoxidase; [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I. Methods In a secondary analysis, we included participants from the Women’s Health Initiative if they had: a previous breast cancer diagnosis (stages I-III), no prior cardiovascular diseases, pre-and post-breast cancer serum samples drawn approximately 3 years apart, and fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 vitality subscale at both serum collections. Biomarkers were measured using ELISA or RT-qPCR and modeled as the log2 post-to pre-breast cancer ratio. Results Overall, 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) years were included. The mean (SD) vitality scores were 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-breast cancer, respectively. Using multivariable weighted linear regression, higher biomarker ratios of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were associated with a lower vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue). For example, for each 2-fold difference in cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: −14.2, −0.45). Conclusion Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation; however, these findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or assessed in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for fatigue."

Abstract 12791: Examining the Association Between Socioeconomic Factors and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Declines in Breast Cancer and Lymphoma Survivors Receiving Doxorubicin: WF-98213,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Breast cancer and lymphoma survivors who have received doxorubicin are at risk of experiencing a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), yet whether socioeconomic factors further impact this decline is unknown.
 
 
 Methods:
 We performed a secondary analysis of data from a double-blinded clinical trial (NCT01988571) in breast cancer and lymphoma survivors that determined the impact of statin use on LVEF 6- and 24-months following initiation of doxorubicin. LVEF was measured via magnetic resonance imaging. Socioeconomic factors were collected via survey. Linear regression models assessed relationships between socioeconomic variables and change in LVEF from baseline to 24 months by individuals blinded to treatment group.
 
 
 Results:
 Of the 279 survivors included in this analysis, a majority were white (82.8%) (13.6% Black, 3.6% other races), college educated (56.3%), and employed (63.8%). Mean LVEF at baseline was 62.2% (SD=6.01) and mean LVEF declines at 6- and 24-months were 4.72% (SD=7.30) and 5.11% (SD=7.20), respectively. In the multivariable model, after controlling for age, race, body mass index, and smoking, patients who made >$75k per year had a significantly smaller LVEF drop (3.36, 95% CI: -0.53, 7.25) at 6-months than patients making less than <$35k per year (8.66, 95% CI: 4.87, 12.45),
 p
 =0.003. Employed patients making >$75k per year had significantly smaller LVEF declines (mean=5.00, 95% CI: 0.14, 9.86) than employed patients making less than 35k per year (mean=9.43, 95% CI: 4.30, 14.56), p=0.033. Lastly, employed patients making >75k had a marginally significantly lower EF drop than unemployed patients making >75k per year (mean=7.83, 95%CI: 3.32, 12.34), p=0.092. These findings occurred independent of statin use.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Findings from this study highlight a need to understand how one’s socioeconomic status (SES), or in terms of social determinants of health, economic stability, may serve as a protective factor regarding LVEF decline during treatment with doxorubicin for breast cancer and lymphoma. Future work should also consider examining the association between SES and care delivery and how that may potentially impact LVEF decline.

Paper Title
Cardiometabolic risk factors, physical activity, and postmenopausal breast cancer mortality: results from the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Higher physical activity levels are associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality. In addition, the metabolic syndrome is associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality. Whether the physical activity association with breast cancer mortality is modified by number of metabolic syndrome components (cardiometabolic risk factors) in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer remains unknown. Methods Cardiovascular risk factors included high waist circumference, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Breast cancers were verified by medical record review. Mortality finding were enhanced by serial National Death Index queries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate associations between baseline physical activity and subsequent breast cancer-specific and overall mortality following breast cancer diagnosis in Women’s Health Initiative participants. These associations were examined after stratifying by cardiometabolic risk factor group. Results Among 161,308 Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) participants, 8543 breast cancers occurred after 9.5 years (median) follow-up in women, additionally with information on cardiometabolic risk factors and physical activity at entry. In multi-variable analyses, as measured from cancer diagnosis, higher physical activity levels were associated with lower all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–0.95, trend P  < 0.001) but not with breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04, trend P  = 0.09). The physical activity and all-cause mortality association was not significantly modified by cardiometabolic risk factor number. Conclusions Among women with early-stage breast cancer, although higher antecedent physical activity was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, the association did not differ by cardiometabolic risk factor number."

Paper Title
Abstract PO029: Oral contraceptive use and postmenopausal sex steroid hormone metabolism,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE: Oral contraceptive (OC) use is common in the United States and high-profile articles have renewed research interest in OC use and cancer risk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how OC use influences postmenopausal cancer risk; one of the leading hypotheses is that OC use fundamentally alters feedback in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis, leading to long term changes in sex steroid hormone metabolism. However, women who use OCs are also unique with respect to factors that may affect both hormone metabolism and cancer risk. No studies have comprehensively commented on hormone levels in postmenopausal women who did and did not use OCs. DESIGN: We examined differences in circulating markers of sex steroid hormone metabolism associated with prior use of OCs among a subcohort of postmenopausal women from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study (983 women with at least one intact ovary and not currently using menopausal hormone therapy). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using highly sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assays, we measured over 30 markers of estrogen and androgen metabolism in study serum samples. We used linear regression (adjusted and weighted) to estimate geometric mean hormone levels, which were then converted into relative percent differences. We controlled for potential confounders and stratified by: lifetime ovulatory cycles, body mass index, and parity (the focus of this abstract). RESULTS: Women with a history of OC use (n=346) had lower levels of estrogen metabolites than women who never used OCs (n=637), particularly when limiting this comparison among parous women (n=158 nulliparous women, n=825 parous women). In parous women, OC use was associated with reductions in total estrone (-18.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -31.1, -3.7%) and in estrogen metabolism overall: 2-hydroxylation metabolites were reduced by -18.5% (CI -28.2, -7.7%), 4-hydroxylation metabolites by -19.9% (CI -29.4, -9.1%), and 16-alpha-hydroxylation metabolites by -24.0% (CI -34.2, -12.2%). Hormone differences associated with OC use among nulliparous women were imprecise. When we made comparisons to nulliparous women who did not use OCs, women who both used OCs and were parous had lower testosterone (-21.2%, CI -33.1, -7.2%) and higher dihydrotestosterone relative to testosterone (its metabolic precursor; 16.5%, CI% -0.6, 36.6). However, aside from lower total estrone (-25.5%, CI -44.6, 0.2%), estrogen metabolism was not different between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: We saw evidence suggesting estrogen metabolism, as reflected in circulating markers, may be lower in postmenopausal women who previously used OCs. These effects were strongest among parous women, likely due to sufficient sample size, rather than any synergistic effect attributable to both using OCs and giving birth. These results support the idea that OC users have lower estrogen levels, but this should be evaluated in other age groups, as differences in hormone metabolism early in the lifecourse may lead women to use OCs.

Paper Title
Associations of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and cardiac damage biomarkers and radiation-induced fatigue in breast cancer survivors.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"191 Background: Radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) is common in breast cancer (BC) survivors and can last years after treatment. Despite the known physiological consequences of radiation, information on biomarkers of RIF is limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-BC fatigue in BC survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), myeloperoxidase (MPO); [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor (PGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B); [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I (TnI). Methods: In an ancillary study in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), participants with incident BC (stages I-III) treated with radiation were followed for the development of fatigue post-BC. Women were eligible if they 1) had no prior cardiovascular disease and 2) had pre-and post-BC serum samples drawn approximately three years apart with fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) vitality subscale at the same times. Biomarkers were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Higher SF-36 vitality scores correspond to lesser fatigue. Weighted linear regression adjusted for relevant demographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors, as well as pre-cancer fatigue. Each biomarker was modeled as the post-BC to pre-BC ratio and log transformed to base 2, thus, the effect estimates correspond to a doubling in value compared to pre-BC. Results: A total of 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) were included. The mean (SD) vitality score was 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-BC, respectively. The median (IQR) time between pre-BC serum collection to BC was 1.9 (0.8, 2.6) years and 1.4 (0.7, 2.3) years between BC and the post-BC serum collection. After adjustment, a higher biomarker ratio of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were all associated with a lower SF-36 vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue) (Table). As an example, for a 2-fold difference in the cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the SF-36 vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: -14.2, -0.45). Conclusions: Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with RIF in BC survivors. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or be included in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for RIF. [Table: see text]"

Abstract 9092: Association of Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cardiac Damage with Long-Term Radiation-Induced Cardiovascular Outcomes in Breast Cancer,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Radiation therapy (RT) is a common component of breast cancer (BC) management, but may be associated with radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD) which includes coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, CVD death, heart failure, or stroke. We examined associations of biomarkers of oxidative stress (MPO, GDF-15, 8-OH-dG, PGF), cardiac injury (TnI, Cystatin-C), inflammation (IL-6, CRP), and myocardial fibrosis (TGF-B) with long-term RICVD in BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 In an ancillary, nested case-control study within the Women’s Health Initiative, postmenopausal women with incident BC stages I-III, who received RT, and had pre- and post-BC diagnosis serum samples available not more than 3 years apart were eligible. Cases were defined as developing incident, physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, CVD death, heart failure, or stroke after BC. Each case was matched to 3 controls on enrollment age and visit year of pre-BC blood draw. Biomarkers were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and modeled as the post-BC to pre-BC ratio and log transformed to base 2. Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and cancer characteristics.
 
 
 Results:
 A total of 55 cases and 158 controls were included with a mean (SD) age of 66.9 (5.5) years and a median (IQR) time from BC diagnosis to post-BC serum collection of 1.4 (0.7, 2.4) years. After adjustment, a higher 8-OH-dG ratio was significantly associated with an elevated risk of RICVD (Table). For a doubling in the biomarker ratio, RICVD risk was 3.04-fold higher (95% CI: 1.01, 9.21). Other biomarkers were not associated with RICVD risk.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this study, higher concentrations of 8-OH-dG were associated with a higher risk of RICVD. This suggests that oxidative DNA damage may be a putative pathway for delayed RICVD. However, given the sample size and multiple testing, further studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings.

Paper Title
Both intermuscular fat and LVEF decline promote heart failure symptoms in cancer survivors,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Background Approximately 20% of cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy experience worsening heart failure (HF) symptoms post-cancer treatment. While research has predominantly investigated the role of cardiotoxic treatments, much less attention has focused on other risk factors, such as adiposity. However, emerging data in cancer survivors indicates that adiposity may also impact a variety of cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: In a prospective study of 62 patients diagnosed with cancer followed for 24 months from cancer diagnosis through to survivorship (post-cancer treatment), we ascertained baseline fat depots including intermuscular fat (IMF) of the erector spinae muscles; and pre- and post-cancer treatment left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and HF symptoms at baseline and 24-months, respectively. Linear regression was used to model independent variables in relation to HF symptoms at 24-months. Results Baseline IMF and LVEF change over 24-months significantly interacted to predict HF score at 24-months. The highest HF symptom score was observed for participants who experienced high IMF at baseline and a high decline in LVEF over 24-months (HF score = 11.0) versus all other categories of baseline IMF and LVEF change. Conclusions Together IMF and LVEF decline may play an important role in the worsening of HF symptoms in cancer survivors. The finding that IMF at cancer diagnosis led to elevated HF scores post-treatment suggests that IMF may be a potential target for intervention studies."

Abstract 11147: Associations of Physical and Mental-Health Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance with Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Post-Menopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and greater sleep disturbance (SD) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. However, these associations may differ in breast cancer (BC) survivors who experience competing risks from cancer and its associated treatment. We examined whether physical or mental HRQoL (including individual subscales) or SD were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) of post-menopausal women free of prevalent CVD at baseline and diagnosed with invasive BC during study follow-up from 1993 - 2010. CVD was defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Scores (PCS and MCS, respectively), and SD, measured by the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale (IRS), were recorded post-BC diagnosis. Higher PCS and MCS scores indicate better HRQoL while higher IRS scores indicate worse SD. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring adjusted for relevant confounders most proximal to or at BC diagnosis.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher PCS scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table). For a 5-unit difference, the risk of CVD was 9% lower for those with higher PCS scores (95% CI: 0.83, 0.99). Of the SF-36 sub-scales, higher scores on vitality, physical functioning, and general health were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In BC survivors, we found that better physical HRQoL was associated with lower CVD risk. While further research is needed to replicate these findings, our results support existing recommendations that women with breast cancer adopt health behaviors that promote physical health.

Paper Title
Risk of metabolic syndrome and metabolic phenotypes in relation to biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein intakes: an investigation from the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased mortality independent of BMI, resulting in discordant metabolic phenotypes, such as metabolically healthy obese and metabolically unhealthy normal-weight individuals. Studies investigating dietary intake in MetS have reported mixed results, due in part to the limitations of self-reported measures.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the role of biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein in MetS and metabolic phenotypes.


METHODS
Postmenopausal participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study who were free of MetS at baseline, had available data from FFQs at baseline, and had components of MetS at Year 3 (n = 3963) were included. Dietary energy and protein intakes were estimated using biomarker calibration methods. MetS was defined as 3 or more of the following: elevated serum triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<50 mg/dL), hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥130 or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg], elevated serum glucose (>100 mg/dL), and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference > 89 cm). Models were adjusted for age, WHI study component, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, recreational physical activity, disease history, and parity.


RESULTS
For every 10% increment in total calibrated energy intake, women were at a 1.37-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.15-1.63); a 10% increment in calibrated total protein intake was associated with a 1.21-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.00-1.47). Specifically, animal protein intake was associated with MetS (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14), whereas vegetable protein intake was not (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03). No differences were seen when examining metabolic phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that higher calibrated total energy, total protein, and total animal protein intakes were strongly associated with MetS. If replicated in clinical trials, these results will have implications for the promotion of energy and animal protein restrictions for the reduction of MetS risks."

Paper Title
Cardiovascular Outcomes in Relation to Antihypertensive Medication Use in Women with and Without Cancer: Results from the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Recent clinical trials have evaluated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta blockers (BBs) in relation to cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer, typically defined by ejection fraction declines. However, these trials have not examined long-term, hard clinical endpoints. Within a prospective study, we examined the risk of heart failure (HF) and coronary heart disease (CHD) events in relation to use of commonly used antihypertensive medications, including ACEis/ARBs, BBs, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and diuretics, comparing women with and without cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In a cohort of 56,997 Women's Health Initiative study participants free of cardiovascular disease who received antihypertensive treatment, we used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of developing CHD, HF, and a composite outcome of cardiac events (combining CHD and HF) in relation to use of ACEis/ARBs, CCBs, or diuretics versus BBs, separately in women with and without cancer.


RESULTS
Whereas there was no difference in risk of cardiac events comparing ACEi/ARB with BB use among cancer-free women (HR = 0.99 [0.88-1.12]), among cancer survivors ACEi/ARB users were at a 2.24-fold risk of total cardiac events (1.18-4.24); p-interaction = .06). When investigated in relation to CHD only, an increased risk was similarly observed in ACEi/ARB versus BB use for cancer survivors (HR = 1.87 [0.88-3.95]) but not in cancer-free women (HR = 0.91 [0.79-1.06]; p-interaction = .04). A similar pattern was also seen in relation to HF but did not reach statistical significance (p-interaction = .23).


CONCLUSION
These results from this observational study suggest differing risks of cardiac events in relation to antihypertensive medications depending on history of cancer. Although these results require replication before becoming actionable in a clinical setting, they suggest the need for more rigorous examination of the effect of antihypertensive choice on long-term cardiac outcomes in cancer survivors.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
Although additional research is needed to replicate these findings, these data from a large, nationally representative sample of postmenopausal women indicate that beta blockers are favorable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing the risk of cardiac events among cancer survivors. This differs from the patterns observed in a noncancer cohort, which largely mirrors what is found in the randomized clinical trials in the general population."

Abstract 13500: Association Between Breast Cancer and Cardiac Autonomic Function as Measured by Heart Rate Variability in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 Background:
 Autonomic dysfunction (AD) as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer. No study has utilized a large prospective multi-center cohort of diverse women to assess differences in HRV associated with incident breast cancer.
 
 
 Objectives:
 To identify heart rate variability changes in women with breast cancer compared to controls in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).
 
 
 Methods:
 In a retrospective cohort study, we utilized 5,031 women in the WHI CT cohort who were breast cancer free at baseline and compared 1) those with incident breast cancer v. 2) those who were breast cancer free during the ECG follow-up period as controls. HRV was calculated utilizing 10-second ECG with two measures of two-domain HRV: standard deviation of all normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences in normal-to-normal RR intervals (rMSSD). HRV was measured from ECGs collected at baseline, years 3, 6, and 9 in the comparison groups. An adjusted mixed linear model was used to evaluate the differences in SDNN and rMSSD comparing women with incident breast cancer to controls. Cardiovascular risk factors utilized in the adjusted model were determined via questionnaire at baseline.
 
 
 Results:
 At baseline, women with incident breast cancer diagnosed by years 3, 6, or 9 were significantly older (median age 63 vs. 61, P<0.0001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (35% vs. 32%, P=0.02). SDNN at years 3 and 6 in women with breast cancer compared to controls was significantly lower (P=0.0002, P=0.03 respectively). As well, rMSSD was significantly lower at year 3 compared to controls (P<0.0001) (
 Figure 1
 ).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 HRV as a measure of AD is significantly lower in women with incident breast cancer compared to women without breast cancer. Reduction in HRV is associated with CVD outcomes in the literature. Our study suggests HRV may predict CVD in breast cancer patients.

Paper Title
Abstract 13885: Phenotyping Risk Profiles for Heart Failure With Preserved and Reduced Ejection Fraction Among Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Breast cancer (BC) survivors (BCS) are at increased risk for incident heart failure (HF). In this population, the risk for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has been understudied compared to HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). The purpose of this study was to estimate 1) the incidence of HFpEF and HFrEF, and 2) the phenotypic profiles conferring risk for incident HFpEF and HFrEF in BCS.
 
 
 Methods:
 This Women’s Health Initiative analysis was conducted in women with invasive BC stages I-IV in the Medical Records Cohort (MRC). Those with pre-existing HF were excluded. Exposures of interest were lifestyle factors [e.g. body mass index (BMI)], comorbidities [e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction (MI)], and BC treatment. Lifestyle factors and comorbidities most proximal and prior to BC diagnosis were assessed. In the MRC, BC and HF as well as left ventricular EF (LVEF) were ascertained through chart review and physician-adjudication. LVEF ≥50% was classified as HFpEF; and <50% for HFrEF per AHA/ACC guidelines. Cox proportional hazards models estimated risks of HFpEF and HFrEF. Follow up time began at BC diagnosis and HF events were recorded through March 1, 2019. All models adjusted for age at BC diagnosis.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,250 BCS, 153 developed HF after BC during a median follow-up of 7.3 years. Of those, 49 had HFrEF and 75 had HFpEF. The cumulative incidences of HFrEF and HFpEF over follow-up were 7.3% and 4.6%, respectively. Diabetes and MI were associated with both HFpEF and HFrEF (Table). Smoking, BMI ≥30, and hypertension were associated with HFpEF. Anthracycline use was associated with HFrEF but not HFpEF (p=0.03).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In BCS, lifestyle factors were associated with incident HFpEF, whereas anthracycline use was associated with a higher risk for HFrEF. Understanding risk factors associated with incident HFpEF and HFrEF in BCS is important to guide the implementation of risk profile-specific preventative measures and interventions.

Paper Title
Sex Hormones in Women With Elevated Breast Cancer Risk Undergoing Weight Loss,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Sedentary lifestyles and obesity are known risk factors for breast cancer. Elevated estrogen levels correlate with obesity and, independently, with increased breast cancer risk. Lifestyle interventions that reduce obesity may mitigate this risk, potentially via estrogen pathways. In a 6-month lifestyle intervention, overweight/obese women with high breast cancer risk were randomized to control (n = 7) or intervention (n = 6) and analyzed for sex hormone levels. Serum and urine hormones were evaluated by ultra performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were reduced by 12.1% and 50.8%, respectively, at 9 months in the intervention group, which differed from controls (p = .043 and .020). This contrasted with a 73.3% increase in urine E1 at 6 months in the intervention group (p = .035). These results suggest that a lifestyle intervention led to a favorable estrogen profile in relation to breast cancer risk."

Prevalence and penetrance of breast cancer-associated mutations identified by multiple-gene sequencing in the Women’s Health Initiative.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"1513 Background: Next-generation sequencing enables rapid analysis of many inherited cancer susceptibility genes. Little is known about the prevalence and penetrance of pathogenic variants (PVs) in such genes among post-menopausal women with breast cancer, who comprise the majority of all breast cancer patients. Methods: The Women’s Health Initiative enrolled post-menopausal women from 1993-1998. We conducted a nested case-control study using banked DNA samples of 2,195 women who subsequently developed invasive breast cancer (cases) and 2,322 cancer-free controls. Sequenced genes were APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A (p16INK4a and p14ARF) , CHEK2, EPCAM, GREM1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11, and TP53. PV were defined using American College of Medical Genetics criteria. PV prevalence is reported as proportions and penetrance as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PV versus none among cases versus controls. Results: Among cases, the median age at diagnosis was 73 years; 66% were White, 18% Black, 6% Hispanic, 6% Asian and 4% other. The prevalence of PVs in any gene was significantly higher in cases (6.61%, 95% CI 5.57-7.65%) versus controls (4.09%, 95% CI 3.29-4.90%). The prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs was 1.2% in cases and 0.22% in controls. Among cases, the prevalence of PVs in other breast cancer-risk genes was 2.3% ( ATM, CDH1, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, NBN, and PALB2 collectively), two-fold higher than PVs in BRCA1/2. Prevalence of BRCA1/2 PVs decreased with age among cases, while prevalence of ATM, CHEK2 and PALB2 PVs did not. Statistically significant ORs for breast cancer penetrance were observed for BRCA1 (5.43, 95% CI 1.19-51.52), BRCA2 (4.71, 95% CI 1.84-15.08), BARD1 (9.78, 95% CI 1.04-1295.87) and PALB2 (6.30, 95% CI 1.93-31.94). Conclusions: Approximately 7% of women diagnosed with post-menopausal breast cancer carry a PV in a cancer susceptibility gene. In contrast to studies of younger breast cancer patients, PVs in other breast cancer-related genes were two times more common than in BRCA1/2. Results may guide genetic testing of women with post-menopausal breast cancer."

Paper Title
Low-fat dietary pattern and breast cancer mortality by metabolic syndrome degree: Secondary analyses of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Dietary Modification randomized trial.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"1539 Background: The WHI Diet Modification (DM) trial randomized 48,835 postmenopausal women with no prior breast cancer to a low-fat dietary intervention or comparison group. After 16.1 years follow-up, the intervention was associated with an 18% reduction in risk of death after breast cancer (P =0.01), with greater reduction (29%) in those with waist circumference≥88 cm (J Clin Oncol 2017). To extend these findings, we examined the influence of the dietary intervention on breast cancer mortality in subgroups defined by number of metabolic syndrome (MS) components with 19.6 years median cumulative follow-up. Methods: WHI DM has been previously described. Four MS components were determined at entry: 1) waist circumference≥ 88 cm, 2) high blood pressure or anti-hypertensive use, 3) high cholesterol history and 4) diabetes history, with women categorized as having 0 (n=10,639), 1-2 (n=30,948), or 3-4 (n=4,246) MS components. Forest plots of hazard ratios (HRs) were generated with P-values for interaction between randomized group assignment and number of MS components. Results: Women with 3-4 MS components were more likely to be Black, be obese (BMI ≥30), and have diabetes (all P < 0.001). Breast cancers in women with 3-4 MS components were less likely to be local stage (P = 0.005) or well differentiated (P = 0.03). The magnitude of reduction in deaths from breast cancer in the dietary intervention vs comparison group increased as the number of MS components increased (interaction P = 0.01). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from breast cancer for intervention vs comparison groups for women with 0 MS components was 1.09 95% CI, 0.63-1.87, with risk low in both randomization groups (0.028% and 0.026%, respectively); for women with 1-2 MS components, HR 0.80 95% CI 0.62-1.02; and for women with 3-4 MS components, HR 0.31 95% CI, 0.14-0.69, with risk in the intervention group reduced to 0.026%. Conclusions: Adoption of a low-fat dietary pattern had a greater effect on reducing deaths from breast cancer in women with more MS components, suggesting that this is a high risk group more likely to benefit from the dietary intervention. Clinical trial information: NCT00000611."

Paper Title
Intentional Weight Loss and Obesity-Related Cancer Risk,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Abstract Background Epidemiologic studies regarding weight loss and subsequent cancer risk are sparse. The study aim was to evaluate the association between weight change by intentionality and obesity-related cancer incidence in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. Eleven cancers were considered obesity related: breast, ovary, endometrium, colon and rectum, esophagus, kidney, liver, multiple myeloma, pancreas, stomach, and thyroid. Methods Postmenopausal women (n = 58 667) aged 50–79 years had body weight and waist circumference (WC) measured at baseline and year 3. Weight or WC change was categorized as stable (change < ±5%), loss (≥5%), and gain (≥5%). Self-report at year 3 characterized weight loss as intentional or unintentional. During the subsequent 12 years (mean) of follow-up, 6033 incident obesity-related cancers were identified. Relationships were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results Compared to women with stable weight, women with intentional weight loss had lower obesity-related cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80 to 0.98). A similar result was observed for intentional WC reduction (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.96). Among all cancers, intentional weight loss was most strongly associated with endometrial cancer (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.88). Intentional WC loss was also associated with lower colorectal cancer risk (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63 to 0.99). Unintentional weight loss or weight gain was not associated with overall obesity-related cancer risk. Conclusion Intentional weight or WC loss in postmenopausal women was associated with lower risk of obesity-related cancer. These findings suggest that postmenopausal women who intentionally lose weight can reduce their obesity-related cancer risk."

Paper Title
Understanding and predicting fatigue, cardiovascular (CV) decline, and events after breast cancer treatment (UPBEAT): A prospective cardio-oncology study.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"TPS11634 Background: Modern treatment for breast cancer (BC) has led to improved survival; however, this improvement can be offset by an increase in cancer therapy-related morbidity and mortality. Over one-third of early stage BC patients treated with cancer therapy experience CV injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, exercise intolerance, or fatigue. CV disease is a leading cause of mortality in BC survivors. There is limited information on the time course and long-term CV health of BC survivors. UPBEAT, a multicenter study, will prospectively evaluate CV risk factors and outcomes in early stage BC patients,treated with modern cancer therapies. This will facilitate evaluation of primary CV prevention strategies in this patient population. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of 840 patients with early stage (I-III) BC treated with chemotherapy +/- radiation and 160 controls. Baseline and serial longitudinal measures will examine the influence of cancer treatment on CV function, exercise capacity and fatigue, and future development of CV events. The comprehensive assessment of factors includes ascertainment of cardiac biomarkers, CV risk factors, comorbidities, functional status (e.g., disability measures, Expanded SPPB), neurocognitive tests, behavioral risk factors, socio-demographics, and quality of life at baseline, 3-, 12-, and 24-mos. Outcomes measured at the same time points, include a deep phenotyping of CV dysfunction (via cardiac MRI assessing LV end diastolic volume, LV end systolic volume, LV ejection fraction, myocardial strain, strain rate, left atrial volumes and mass, and aortic stiffness), exercise intolerance (submaximal as 6-minute walk test and maximal as VO2peak via cardiopulmonary exercise test), fatigue (via FACT-F). Eligibility criteria are: age >18 years; ECOG 0-2, able to walk without symptoms; and for BC patients, treatment with chemotherapy. 143 participants are accrued and currently enrolling through ECOG and NCORP sites. Participants will be followed for 9 years with active surveillance of CV events, i.e., heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, all-cause and CV death. Clinical trial information: NCT02791581."

Paper Title
Short-Term Outcomes of a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Institute for Nursing Faculty.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Student populations in the United States are increasingly diverse, prompting the need to make learning environments in schools of nursing more inclusive. Training for faculty is needed to support this work; however, evidence regarding best practices to make classrooms more inclusive is lacking.


METHOD
A 3-day Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Institute was developed and conducted to create inclusive learning environments; facilitate crucial conversations on racism and other -isms, especially in the context of nursing and health equity; and practice these skills and develop or transform at least one actual class activity.


RESULTS
DEI Institute satisfaction and impact were overwhelmingly positive, and statistically significant increases in DEI-related teaching self-efficacy were observed post-Institute (p values ranging from .0004 to < .0001).


CONCLUSION
The DEI Institute is one example of a successful approach that can create inclusive learning environments and address issues related to health equity. [J Nurs Educ. 2019;58(11):633-640.]."

Abstract GS5-07: Weight change in postmenopausal women and breast cancer risk in the women's health initiative observational study,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"Purpose While obesity is an established breast cancer risk factor, information about the influence of weight loss on breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women is mixed precluding generation of a strong public health message regarding potential benefits of weight loss with respect to cancer risk. Therefore, we evaluated associations between weight change and invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women participating in the Women9s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study. Patients and Methods Postmenopausal women (n=61,335) with no prior breast cancer and normal mammogram who were not underweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 18.5 kg/m2), ages 50-79 years at WHI enrollment between 1993 and 1998 at 40 US clinical centers, had body weight and height measured and BMI calculated at the clinical centers at baseline and at year 3. Weight change over 3 years was categorized as: stable (no change ≤ 5%), loss (change ≥ 5%), or gain (change ≥ 5%) with weight lost intentionality determined by self-report response to direct query at year 3. Breast cancers were initially ascertained through annual survey and were centrally confirmed by medical record review. Multi-variable Cox proportional hazards regression models incorporating breast cancer risk factors and baseline BMI were used to evaluate relationships between weight change and breast cancer incidence. Results During 11.4 years (mean) of follow-up, 3,061 women developed invasive breast cancer. In multi-variable analyses, compared with women with stable weight (n=41,139), women with weight loss (≥ 5%) (n=8,175) had a significantly lower breast cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.98). Adjustment for mammography did not alter findings (HR 0.88 95% CI 0.78-0.99). There was no significant interaction for breast cancer effect by weight loss intentionality. Women with weight loss ≥ 15% had even lower breast cancer risk (HR 0.63 95% CI 0.45-0.90). While weight gain (≥ 5%) (n=12,021) was not associated with higher overall breast cancer risk, women with weight gain had a significantly higher risk of triple negative breast cancer (HR 1.54 95% CI 1.16-2.05). Weight change association with breast cancer incidence was examined in four subgroups: by tumor subtype (hormone receptor and HER2 status based), baseline BMI (normal, overweight, obese), race/ethnicity, and age group (50, - Conclusion Weight loss in postmenopausal women is associated with lower breast cancer risk. These findings suggest that postmenopausal women who lose weight may reduce their breast cancer risk.

Paper Title
A systematic review of symptom experiences in survivors of colorectal cancer.,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"186 Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosis in the US. With expanding survival rates, increasing numbers of CRC survivors live with long-term disease and treatment-side effects. There is limited research about symptom experiences from which to provide evidence-based symptom management guidelines for CRC survivors. This study systematically reviews published studies on symptoms in CRC survivors, with an aim to understand symptom experiences and with a broad goal of developing effective symptom interventions and improving CRC survivorship. Methods: A systematic search for relevant studies between the years 2005-2018 was conducted with Scopus, CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and PsycINFO. A systematic literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Results: Of an initial 588 unique studies, 33 were identified for inclusion in the systematic review. The majority of studies were conducted in the UK or had a cross-sectional design. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-C30 was the most frequently used instrument to assess symptoms. When we converted symptom severity scores and symptom occurrences among CRC survivors on a 0-100 scale, the most severe and frequently reported symptom across the 33 studies was fecal incontinence (mean severity: 50 points; mean occurrence: 52%), followed by fatigue (mean severity: 49 points; mean occurrence: 44%). Patients who reported lack of symptom management information, poor family and social supports, and presence of a stoma also reported more frequent and more severe symptoms. Symptom experiences were correlated with poor quality of life, low physical activity, daily life interferences, problems with sexual relationships, financial concerns, and negative body image. Conclusions: CRC survivors experienced a unique set of symptoms. Research is needed on symptom trajectories across the cancer continuum, strategies to incorporate family and other social supports for managing symptoms, and to enhance communication between oncologists, patients and caregivers that will support improved symptom control."

Abstract A34: Impact of a lifestyle intervention on metabolic pathways: Results from the Diet, Exercise, Emotional Processing, and Mindfulness (DEEM) intervention,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"Abstracts: AACR Special Conference: Metabolism and Cancer; June 7-10, 2015; Bellevue, WA

Background: Breast cancer is the most common non-dermatologic malignancy in women. One-fifth of breast cancers can be attributed to sedentary lifestyles and overweight/obesity. More than two-thirds of U.S. women are overweight or obese. Excess body weight and body fat may affect breast cancer risk through a number of mechanisms, including metabolic pathways (i.e., adipokines, inflammation, and insulin) and estrogen metabolism. To date, limited research has investigated the impact of lifestyle interventions on metabolic changes among women at high risk for breast cancer. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of the 6-month exercise and diet intervention and to explore the impact of lifestyle intervention versus control on metabolic changes.

Methods: Participants were recruited through the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Sixteen women were randomized with half assigned to the control group. Eligible women were 35-65 years of age, had a body mass index (BMI) between 28-40, and were at high risk of breast cancer. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans, questionnaire data, blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 9- months. The DEEM lifestyle intervention is an individually-tailored intervention that includes motivational enhancement therapy, cognitive and behavioral skills training, and psychological education. Group counseling sessions were conducted weekly for 3 months then tapered over next 3 months. We measured the changes in weight, percent adiposity, central waist/hip circumferences, plasma biomarkers (adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein [CRP], Interleukin-6 [IL-6], Homeostatic Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]), and urinary estrogen metabolites (Estrogen DNA Adduct [EDA]).

Results: Results showed an average weight loss of 4.1 kg (- 4.6 %) in intervention group versus controls (weight gain 1.4 kg, +1.6 %) at 6 months ( p = 0.02). Intervention participants experienced a decrease in percent mean adiposity (-3 %) and waist circumference (-0.2 inches) but no change in hip circumference; controls had increases in all 3 measures (+1.5 %, +0.7 inches, +2.9 inches). These changes were not significantly different. Self-reported physical activity differed between intervention and control participants (6.8 versus.1.4 hrs. /wk., p = 0.01). On average vegetable, fruit, protein intake increased and carbohydrate intake decreased only in intervention group, but not significantly different from controls. Women in the intervention arm reduced plasma CRP (mg/dL) from 0.39 to 0.26 (- 0.13 [34.5 %]) versus from 0.45 to 0.63 (+ 0.18 [39 %]) in controls ( p = 0.06); and reduced plasma leptin (ng/ml) from 18.1 to 14.7 (-3.4 [18 %]) versus from 21.8 to 21.9 (+0.1 [0.1 %]) in controls ( p = 0.10). Twenty-five percent of the intervention participants went from insulin resistant to non-insulin resistant (HOMA-IR< 2.0), while none of the controls reduced their HOMA-IR. No significant differences were observed in adiponectin, IL-6 and EDA.

Conclusion: In this pilot study, the DEEM intervention facilitated weight loss and reduced adiposity. Our findings also suggest that a lifestyle intervention can improve the metabolic health of overweight/obese women at high risk of breast cancer. Future work is needed to confirm this finding in a large-scale study.

Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography Coupled to Multiple Reaction Monitoring Enables Reproducible Quantification of Phospho-signaling*,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"A major goal in cell signaling research is the quantification of phosphorylation pharmacodynamics following perturbations. Traditional methods of studying cellular phospho-signaling measure one analyte at a time with poor standardization, rendering them inadequate for interrogating network biology and contributing to the irreproducibility of preclinical research. In this study, we test the feasibility of circumventing these issues by coupling immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)-based enrichment of phosphopeptides with targeted, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry to achieve precise, specific, standardized, multiplex quantification of phospho-signaling responses. A multiplex immobilized metal affinity chromatography- multiple reaction monitoring assay targeting phospho-analytes responsive to DNA damage was configured, analytically characterized, and deployed to generate phospho-pharmacodynamic curves from primary and immortalized human cells experiencing genotoxic stress. The multiplexed assays demonstrated linear ranges of ≥3 orders of magnitude, median lower limit of quantification of 0.64 fmol on column, median intra-assay variability of 9.3%, median inter-assay variability of 12.7%, and median total CV of 16.0%. The multiplex immobilized metal affinity chromatography- multiple reaction monitoring assay enabled robust quantification of 107 DNA damage-responsive phosphosites from human cells following DNA damage. The assays have been made publicly available as a resource to the community. The approach is generally applicable, enabling wide interrogation of signaling networks."

Paper Title
Associations between Dietary Intake of Fruits and Vegetables in relation to Urinary Estrogen DNA Adduct Ratio.,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Estrogen exposure plays a role in breast cancer (BC) development. A novel estrogen biomarker, the estrogen DNA adduct (EDA) ratio, was shown to be elevated in women at high-risk of BC and among BC cases. Modifiable factors may impact the EDA ratio, with studies demonstrating that resveratrol reduces EDA ratio in vitro. We sought to examine the hypothesis that dietary intake of fruits and vegetables is inversely associated with EDA ratio.


METHODS
This analysis was conducted in 53 pre-menopausal, healthy women aged 40-45 years from a cross-sectional study in which participants provided first-void urine samples and 3-day food records. Urine samples were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The EDA ratio was calculated as the estrogen-DNA adducts divided by estrogen metabolites and conjugates. A trend test was used to assess associations between tertiles of dietary intake using linear regression.


RESULTS
After adjustment for age, total energy, percent adiposity, serum estradiol and estrone-sulfate, we observed inverse associations of EDA ratio with carbohydrate consumption (P=0.01) and vegetable intake (P =0.01). EDA ratio was inversely associated with 5 botanical groups (Chenopodiaceae: P=0.02; Umbelliferae: P=0.03; Compositae: P=0.01; Ericaceae: P=0.01; Musaceae: P=0.03) but not fruit intake overall.


CONCLUSION
Although these data require replication before conclusions are drawn, this report suggests an inverse association between vegetable and carbohydrate consumption and EDA ratio.


IMPACT
While more information is still needed, these findings suggest a link between dietary intake and a biomarker that is both associated with high-risk BC status and associated with modifiable factors."

Resilience among patients across the cancer continuum: diverse perspectives.,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"Each phase of the cancer experience profoundly affects patients' lives. Much of the literature has focused on negative consequences of cancer; however, the study of resilience may enable providers to promote more positive psychosocial outcomes before, during, and after the cancer experience. The current review describes the ways in which elements of resilience have been defined and studied at each phase of the cancer continuum. Extensive literature searches were conducted to find studies assessing resilience during one or more stages of the adult cancer continuum. For all phases of the cancer continuum, resilience descriptions included preexisting or baseline characteristics, such as demographics and personal attributes (e.g., optimism, social support), mechanisms of adaptation, such as coping and medical experiences (e.g., positive provider communication), as well as psychosocial outcomes, such as growth and quality of life. Promoting resilience is a critical element of patient psychosocial care. Nurses may enable resilience by recognizing and promoting certain baseline characteristics and optimizing mechanisms of adaptation."

Abstract A89: Examination of ancestral informative markers and self-reported race with tumor characteristics of breast cancer among black and white women,

Year
2011,

Abstract
"African American (AA) women have higher mortality from breast cancer (BC) compared to European American (EA) women. This may be due to the higher proportion of AA women with tumors that are diagnosed at advanced stage and are estrogen receptor negative (ER-) /progesterone receptor negative (PR-). Our study sought to determine whether self-reported race and percent African ancestry were associated with BC tumor characteristics. In a multi-center, population-based case-control study of BC, we determined percent African ancestry using ancestry informative markers (AIM) among women self-reporting as Black. While self-reported race was associated with several BC tumor characteristics, AIMs markers among AA women were not. Specifically, women self-reporting as Black were at a 30% reduction in ER+/PR+ tumors (95% CI: 0.6–0.9), a non-significant risk of ER-/PR-tumors (OR = 1.3 [95% CI: 0.9–1.7]), a 1.4-fold increased risk of regional/distant stage (95% CI: 1.1–1.7) and a 1.5-fold increased risk of high grade tumors (95% CI: 1.2–1.9) compared to EA women. Percent African ancestry was not associated with any BC tumor characteristics (OR=1.0 for ER+/PR+ [95% CI: 0.6–1.8], OR = 0.9 for ER-/PR-[95% CI: 0.5–1.6], OR = 1.3 for regional/distant stage [95% CI: 0.8–2.1], and OR=0.9 for high-grade tumors [95% CI: 0.6–1.4] comparing those with ≥95% African ancestry to those with Citation Information: Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2011;20(10 Suppl):A89."

Abstract
"The Healthy Brain Initiative: National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health (2007) called on the research community to disseminate its work on cognitive aging and cognitive health. The purpose of this scoping review was to (1) identify terminology that cognitive, social, and behavioral scientists use to describe cognitive aging and cognitive health, in association with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, among older adults; (2) demonstrate how such terms are defined; and (3) illustrate how these constructs are measured in research settings. Empirical studies published 2007–2018 were examined for terminology, definitions, disciplinary orientation, and measurement mechanisms. Analysis of the corpus and a detailed review of the terms “cognitive impairment” and “mild cognitive impairment” reveal that formal definitions are provided infrequently and measurement of constructs ranges widely. Overall, the variability in terminology, definitions, and measures reflects a need for greater specificity in research communication, such that cross-disciplinary collaboration can be facilitated.","

2019,

Abstract
"Abstract The Healthy Brain Initiative: National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health (2007) called on the research community to more widely disseminate its work on cognitive aging and cognitive health. However, communication beyond individual disciplines is complex. We identified terminology that social scientists use to describe cognitive aging and cognitive health among older adults, demonstrated how such terms are defined, and illustrated how these constructs are being measured. We searched terms such as Alzheimer* and dementia in studies between 2007 and 2018 (n=209). Geriatrics (n=95), neurology (n=81), psychiatry (n=65), and psychology (n=30) were most common disciplines; however, there was no consistency in how terms were used within and across disciplines. A detailed review of “cognitive impairment” and “mild cognitive impairment” demonstrated that formal definitions were provided infrequently and measurement of constructs ranged widely. The variability in terminology, definitions and measures reflects a need for greater specificity in research communication."

OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT IN EARLY-STAGE MEMORY LOSS INTERVENTIONS: A SCOPING REVIEW,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Abstract Psychosocial and psychoeducational groups are widely recommended for individuals with early stage Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, measurement challenges have hindered researchers’ efforts to demonstrate the efficacy of these groups. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify common measurement tools used in interventions for individuals with early stage ADRD and to develop suggestions for future investigations. CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched; 102 studies were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were set to capture intervention studies that utilized quantifiable measures with participants over age 50. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (73%) employed randomized controlled trial designs. Sample sizes ranged from N=20-236. Most commonly measured outcomes included depression, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and quality of life, but there was little consensus on how to best measure these outcomes. Standardization of psychosocial assessment tools are needed for future intervention studies with early stage ADRD."

Paper Title
Toward Assessment of Dementia Caregiver Activation for Health Care: An Integrative Review of Related Constructs and Measures.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"The purpose of this integrative literature review was to establish the rationale for a new measure of dementia caregiver activation for health care. Little is known about how caregivers form working partnerships with clinicians to manage the health of individuals who, because of cognitive impairment and functional limitations, can no longer actively manage their own health. Building on three sources-the construct of patient activation, an empirical health care framework for individuals living with dementia, and a set of dementia care quality indicators-the construct of dementia caregiver activation for health care was defined and initial relevant domains were specified. An integrative literature review was performed to identify related constructs and assess currently available measures with respect to their inclusion of these key health care domains. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 647 citations were reviewed and reduced to 17 studies, which were included in the analysis and qualitative synthesis. No existing measure was found that captures all of the domains required for caregiver-clinician partnership, establishing the need for a novel measure of caregiver activation focused on the health care of individuals living with dementia.

The Community Heart Failure Program: A Trauma-Informed Heart Failure Management Strategy.,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Individuals with heart failure (HF) and adverse social determinants of health (SDOH) experience significant health care disparities.


LOCAL PROBLEM
We noted high rates of acute care utilization by patients with adverse SDOH and unmet social needs.


METHODS
This pilot quality improvement project used a pre-post design.


INTERVENTION
A nurse-led, trauma-informed, community-based HF program (CHFP) was developed, providing care at each patient's chosen location (eg, shelter, tent). Guideline-directed medical therapy was adjusted to achieve patient goals.


RESULTS
Sixteen patients participated in the CHFP. Reductions were seen in the number of emergency department visits, mean number of hospitalizations, and days hospitalized. The number of patients with ≥1 hospitalization significantly decreased from 12 to 5 (P = .07). Cardiology outpatient encounters significantly increased from 11.19 to 19.38 (P = .02).


CONCLUSIONS
CHFP reduced acute care utilization and has the potential to improve patient outcomes."

Abstract 16395: Caregiver Challenges, Needs, and Health Outcomes After Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Caregivers of patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) experience significant strain in caring for patients after device implant, yet few studies have captured underlying caregiver needs and the impact on caregiver health.
 
 
 Aim:
 To describe caregiver challenges, needs, and health outcomes at three distinct time points following LVAD implant.
 
 
 Method:
 Using a cross-sectional, concurrent mixed methods design, patients were interviewed at 1 of 3 time points during LVAD recovery: at hospitalization after LVAD implant (n=3), at 1 month (n=9) , or 3 months (n=7) after returning home. Key health outcomes (measures) included caregiver Roles and Responsibilities (CRRS), mental health (SF-12 MCS), and physical function (Duke Activity Status Index, DASI). Qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis; qualitative and quantitative findings were integrated using matrix displays across time points.
 
 
 Results:
 Caregivers (N=19) were 60.0±9.6 years old, 68% married, 88% female, 56% with 2 or more comorbidities, and 56% caring for Destination Therapy patients. Three phases of caregiving were characterized. At 1 month, caregiver burden was highest (CRRS: hospitalization after implant= 32±12.7; 1 mo = 51.6±7.8; 3 mo = 47.3±8.9); physical function lowest (DASI: hospitalization after implant = 53.7±5.3; 1 mo = 38.1±9.7; 3 mo = 42.1±15.6); and mental health highest (SF-12: hospitalization after implant = 43.4±7.8; 1 mo = 55.8±25.9; 3 mo = 48.3±26.8). Qualitative analyses validated caregiving challenges and health impact at 1 month (isolation, constant caregiving, uncertainty) and low physical function (work of caregiving, disrupted sleep), while simultaneously underscoring positive mental health effects (gratitude for a second chance, establishing routines, experiencing support).
 
 
 Conclusion:
 The characterization of three phases of caregiving after LVAD implantation provides important new insights necessary for targeted interventions for LVAD caregivers. Identified targets to relieve caregiver burden and improve adjustment after patients are discharged home include the need for relief from isolation and 24/7 caregiving, promotion of sleep and routines, and social support.

Person-Centered Models for Cardiovascular Care: A Review of the Evidence: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States and globally. Disease burden continues to escalate despite technological advances associated with improved life expectancy and quality of life. As a result, longer life is associated with multiple chronic cardiovascular conditions. Clinical guidelines provide recommendations without considering prevalent scenarios of multimorbidity and health system complexities that affect practical adoption. The diversity of personal preferences, cultures, and lifestyles that make up one’s social and environmental context is often overlooked in ongoing care planning for symptom management and health behavior support, hindering adoption and compromising patient outcomes, particularly in groups at high risk. The purpose of this scientific statement was to describe the characteristics and reported outcomes in existing person-centered care delivery models for selected cardiovascular conditions. We conducted a scoping review using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 2010 to 2022. A range of study designs with a defined aim to systematically evaluate care delivery models for selected cardiovascular conditions were included. Models were selected on the basis of their stated use of evidence-based guidelines, clinical decision support tools, systematic evaluation processes, and inclusion of the patient’s perspective in defining the plan of care. Findings reflected variation in methodological approach, outcome measures, and care processes used across models. Evidence to support optimal care delivery models remains limited by inconsistencies in approach, variation in reimbursement, and inability of health systems to meet the needs of patients with chronic, complex cardiovascular conditions."

Abstract 9472: Effects of Social Determinants of Health on ICD Shocks, Hospitalizations, & Mortality in the First Year After an ICD,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Disparities in the receipt of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) have been reported. African Americans (AA), women, and those with lower SES are less likely to receive an ICD and more likely to report poor outcomes after ICD implant. The
 purpose
 of this study was to determine if social determinants of health (SDOH) were associated with the number of ICD shocks experienced, all cause hospitalization, or mortality in the first year following receipt of an initial ICD.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 SDOH (age, race, biological sex, annual income, employment, education, rural vs urban locale) are related to total ICD shocks, all cause hospitalization, and mortality in the first year after an initial ICD.
 
 
 Methods:
 301 patients who received an initial ICD (58% primary prevention, 42% secondary prevention) were followed for 1 year. Patients were 64
 ±
 2 years old, 91% Caucasian, 4% AA, 2% Am Indian (AI), 2% Latinx, 74% male, 87% urban , 65% retired-disabled, 45% household income < $50K, and 48% high school education or less. ICD shocks, hospitalizations, & deaths were verified using the EMR. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine for SHOD related disparities in health outcomes over 1 year.
 
 
 Results:
 There were
 no
 significant associations between SDOH and ICD shocks, all cause hospitalization, or mortality over 1 year.
 ICD shocks
 : 34 patients (11.3%) had at least 1 ICD shock over 12-months of follow-up. The number of ICD shocks was higher for those who engaged in hazardous drinking (25%: 5% women, 20% men, p=0.03), and those who received an ICD for secondary prevention (primary 8.4%, secondary 15.4% (p=0.04) at baseline..
 Hospitalization
 : 95 patients (31.6%) were hospitalized over the 12 months of follow-up.
 Mortality
 : 9 (3%) deaths (67% cardiac related) were recorded over the 12 months, with no associations found between SDOH and mortality.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 SDOH were not associated with the incidence of ICD shocks, all-cause hospitalization, or mortality in the first year after receipt of an initial ICD. SDOH influences on access to receipt of an initial ICD may have contributed to the observed outcomes post-ICD.

Physical function, psychological adjustment, and self-efficacy following sudden cardiac arrest and an initial implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in a social cognitive theory intervention: secondary analysis of a randomized control trial,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivorship results in unique issues in return to physical and psychological function. The purpose of the study was to compare recovery across the first year between SCA survivors and other arrhythmia patients who received a first-time implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention, participating in a social cognitive theory (SCT) intervention. Methods 168 (129 males, 39 females) who received an ICD for secondary prevention (SCA N = 65; other arrhythmia N = 103) were randomized to one of two study conditions: SCT intervention (N = 85) or usual care (N = 83). Outcomes were measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months: (1) Physical Function: Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS); (2) Psychological Adjustment: State Trait Anxiety (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 (MCS); (3) Self-Efficacy: Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management Behaviors (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE). Outcomes were compared over 12 months for intervention condition x ICD indication using general estimating equations. Results Participants were Caucasian (89%), mean age 63.95 ± 12.3 years, EF% 33.95 ± 13.9, BMI 28.19 ± 6.2, and Charlson Index 4.27 ± 2.3. Physical symptoms (PCA) were higher over time for SCA survivors compared to the other arrhythmia group ( p  = 0.04), ICD shocks were lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention ( p  = 0.01); psychological adjustment (MCS) was significantly lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention over 6 months, which improved at 12 months ( p  = 0.05); outcome expectations (OE) were significantly lower for SCA survivors in the SCT intervention ( p  = 0.008). Conclusions SCA survivors had greater number of physical symptoms, lower levels of mental health and outcome expectations over 12 months despite participation in a SCT intervention.

Abstract 12802: Trajectory of Recovery Following Sudden Cardiac Arrest After an Initial Icd in a Social Cognitive Theory Intervention,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) survivorship results in unique issues in return to physical & psychological functioning. The
 purpose
 of this study was to examine trajectories of recovery between SCA survivors & other patients who received an initial secondary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) & participated in a social cognitive theory (SCT) intervention.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 One-year recovery trajectories will differ for SCA survivors vs others who received an ICD for secondary prevention.
 
 
 Methods:
 168 (129 men, 39 women) who received an ICD for secondary prevention [VF cardiac arrest (N=65), ICD other reason (N=103)] were randomized to a SCT intervention (N=85) or usual care (N=83). The SCT intervention consisted of 8 weeks of nurse led telephone coaching & self-management strategies to enhance recovery over 1 year. Outcomes measured at baseline hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, & 12 months included: 1)
 Physical Function
 [Patient Concerns Assessment (PCA), SF-36 (PCS)]; 2)
 Psychological Adjustment
 [State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), CES-D depression, SF-36 (MCS)]; & 3)
 Self-Efficacy
 [SCA Self-Efficacy (SCA-SE), Self-management behaviors (SMB), Outcome Expectations (OE)]. Outcome differences were compared over 12 months by intervention group (SCT vs UC) & by SCA vs. ICD-other groups, using general estimating equations (GEE), adjusting for baseline age, gender, & ethnicity.
 
 
 Results:
 Participants were Caucasian (89%), averaged 63.95±12.3 years, EF% 33.95±13.9, BMI 28.19±6.2, & Charlson Index 4.27±2.3. No significant demographic differences were noted between groups. Physical function (PCS) remained low & anxiety (STAI) high in all groups over time. Self-efficacy (SCA-SE) was lower in SCA survivors compared to others. Physical symptoms (PCA) decreased significantly (Wald
 X
 2,
 8.38, p=0.04) for SCA survivors vs. ICD-others over 1 year; Psychological Adjustment (MCS) was significantly lower in SCA survivors in the SCT intervention at 6 months & recovered at 12 months (Wald

Abstract 13826: Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Clusters Increase Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Symptoms are a predictor of hospitalizations in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF). Symptom clusters are groups of two or more symptoms that are related due to shared mechanisms or a shared impact on outcomes. The impact of AF specific symptom clusters on hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits has not previously been examined.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 We assessed the hypothesis that symptom clusters were associated with AF-related hospitalizations and ED visits.
 
 
 Methods:
 We examined pre-existing data for 1,501 adults in the Vanderbilt AF Registry, a clinical biorepository that prospectively enrolls both AF patients and their family members. Our sample consists of subjects with confirmed AF and a completed symptom survey (derived from the University of Toronto AF Severity Scale, Chronbach’s α for symptom burden is 0.94). Seven common AF symptoms were measured on a 5 point Likert scale. Our outcomes were self-reported number of AF-related hospitalizations and ED visits in the past 12 months. To identify symptom clusters we used hierarchical cluster analysis, Ward’s method, and Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure. The ideal number of clusters was determined with dendrograms, pseudo F, and pseudo T. We used Poisson regression to examine whether the identified clusters were associated with hospitalization and ED visit rates controlling for clinical characteristics.
 
 
 Results:
 Our sample was primarily male (67%) and Caucasian (96%) with a mean age of 58.4 (± 12.2) years. Two symptom clusters were identified, which we labeled the
 At Rest
 cluster (fatigue at rest, shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, and dizziness) and the
 With Activity
 cluster (shortness of breath with activity and exercise intolerance). Palpitations was the only symptom that did not cluster with other symptoms. Subjects who experienced all the symptoms in the At Rest cluster had an adjusted incident rate ratio for hospitalizations of 1.9 (p<0.0001) and for ED visits of 2.8 (p<0.0001). There was no statistically significant association between the With Activity cluster and either clinical outcome.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 We identified two AF-specific symptom clusters. Only the At Rest cluster was significantly associated with AF-related hospitalizations and ED visits.

Person-focused interventions for fall risk assessment, fall prevention and fall injury prevention in long-term care facilities: a scoping review,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Objective Falls are a significant concern in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) as fall-related injuries can result in functional impairment, disability and death. Older adults living in LTCFs are at greater risk for falls than those in the community. Using scoping review methodology, we aimed to synthesise evidence examining intervention effects of person-focused interventions for risk assessment and prevention in LTCFs in order to identify evidence-based practices in LTCFs. Methods We included three databases (Ovid-Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE) to identify original research from 2007 to 2022 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guideline. From the initial search, we identified 988 articles. Following the removal of duplicates, title and abstract screening, and full-text review against inclusion/exclusion criteria, 20 studies remained for analysis. Then, we conducted a narrative synthesis to summarise the included studies. Results Identified evidence-based interventions for fall prevention include (1) exercise programmes (eg, high-intensity functional exercise, aerobic exercise, short stick exercises, etc); (2) multifactorial programmes; and (3) other interventions (eg, lavender olfactory stimulation). Outcomes of included studies included the number of falls, fall rate, risk of falls and fear of falls before and after interventions. Conclusion Overall, most studies reported significant effects of person-focused interventions in LTCFs. Available evidence supports that well-designed person-focused interventions can reduce falls and fear of falls for individuals in LTCFs."

System-level interventions for fall risk assessment, fall prevention and fall injury prevention in long-term care facilities: a scoping review,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Objectives Older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at high risk for falls. Interventions to prevent falls and fall-related injury in this population may be individual-level or system-focused interventions. However, relatively little attention has been given to research on system-focused interventions. This scoping review seeks to synthesise previous studies on the effects of system-focused interventions for fall prevention in LTCFs. Methods We searched Ovid-Medline, CINAHL and Embase databases from 2007 to 2024 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews. We conducted a narrative synthesis to summarise findings from the included studies. Results In the initial search, 403 studies were identified and underwent title and abstract screening resulting in 116 articles retrieved for full-text review. 20 studies were included in the final data extraction. System-level fall prevention interventions evaluated in LTCFs include (1) multicomponent and multidisciplinary programmes, (2) environmental adaptations, (3) technological adaptations, and (4) staff education and training programmes. 11 out of 17 included quantitative studies reported significant effects of system-focused interventions to reduce falls in LTCFs. Conclusions This scoping review reveals the effectiveness of system-level fall prevention strategies in LTCFs. Enhancing training, customising tools and fostering a supportive leadership culture are vital for improving fall prevention practices in LTCFs."

Virtual Reality Meditation for Fatigue in Persons With Rheumatoid Arthritis: Mixed Methods Pilot Study,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Effective symptom management is crucial to enhancing the quality of life for individuals with chronic diseases. Health care has changed markedly over the past decade as immersive, stand-alone, and wearable technologies including virtual reality have become available. One chronic pain population that could benefit from such an intervention is individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent pharmacologic advances in the management of RA have led to a decrease in inflammatory symptoms (eg, chronic pain) or even disease remission, yet up to 70% of patients with RA still suffer from fatigue. While VR-delivered behavior, meditation, and biofeedback programs show promise for pain and anxiety management, there is little information on the use of virtual reality meditation (VRM) for fatigue management among individuals with RA. Objective This study aims to (1) examine the feasibility of implementing a study protocol that uses VRM, (2) determine the acceptability of using VRM for fatigue management in an outpatient population, and (3) identify barriers and contextual factors that might impact VRM use for fatigue management in outpatients with RA. Methods We used a convergent, mixed methods design and enrolled adults aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of RA. Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS) measures of fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain behavior, and physical function were assessed alongside the brief mood introspection scale at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks. VRM use across the 4-week study period was automatically stored on headsets and later extracted for analysis. Semistructured interview questions focused on feedback regarding the participant’s experience with RA, previous experience of fatigue, strategies participants use for fatigue management, and the participant’s experience using VRM and recommendations for future use. Results A total of 13 participants completed this study. Most participants completed all study surveys and measures (11/13, 84% and 13/13, 100%, respectively) and were active participants in interviews at the beginning and end of the program. Participants used VRM an average of 8.9 (SD 8.5) times over the course of the 4-week program. Most participants enjoyed VRM, found it relaxing, or recommended its use (12/13, 92%), but 8 (62%) noted barriers and conceptual factors that impacted VRM use. On average, participants saw decreases in PROMIS fatigue (–6.4, SD 5.1), depression (–5.6, SD 5.7), anxiety (–4.5, SD 6), and pain behavior (–3.9, SD 5.3), and improvements in PROMIS physical function (1.5, SD 2.7) and Brief Mood Introspection Scale mood (5.3, SD 6.7) over the course of this 4-week study. Conclusions While this study’s implementation was feasible, VRM’s acceptability as an adjunctive modality for symptom management in RA is contingent on effectively overcoming barriers to use and thoughtfully addressing the contextual factors of those with RA to ensure successful intervention deployment.

Fatigue, Toll-Like Receptor 4, and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Adults With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A 6-Month Longitudinal Study,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Fatigue is prevalent in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) survivors. Biological mechanisms underlying fatigue post-SAH are not clear. Inflammation may contribute to the development of fatigue. This study aimed to examine the associations between inflammatory markers and fatigue during the first 6 months post-SAH. Specific biomarkers examined included both early and concurrent expression of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) messenger RNA (mRNA) and plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin (IL)1β, and IL6. Methods We conducted a 6-month longitudinal study with a convenience sample of 43 SAH survivors. We collected blood samples on days 2, 3, and 7 and 2, 3, and 6 months post-SAH to assess biomarkers. Fatigue was assessed by the PROMIS Fatigue Scale at 2, 3, and 6 months. Linear mixed models were used to test the associations between early (days 2, 3, and 7) and concurrent (2, 3, and 6 months) TLR4 mRNA expression (TagMan gene expression assays) and TNF-α, IL1β, and IL6 plasma concentrations (multiplex assays) and concurrent fatigue. Results 28% of SAH survivors experienced fatigue during the first 6 months post-SAH. Fatigue levels in SAH survivors were higher than those of the U.S. population and consistent during the 6 months. Experience of fatigue during the 6 months post-SAH was associated with higher IL1β plasma concentrations on day 7 and IL1β, IL6, and TNF-α plasma concentrations during the 6 months post-SAH. Conclusion Inflammation appears to underlie the development of fatigue in SAH survivors."

Abstract P2117: Associations of cardiac biomarkers with physical activity and sedentary behavior in postmenopausal women,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"
 Background:
 Associations of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) with biomarkers of cardiac stress could have implications for cardiovascular resiliency in aging women but are understudied.
 
 
 Methods:
 Postmenopausal women (50-79 years old at Women’s Health Initiative enrollment) (a) without known CHD, (b) with available self-reported usual PA and SB information, and (c) with available blood biomarkers for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP mg/L; inflammation), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA ng/mL; fibrinolysis), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic protein (NT-proBNP pg/mL; volume overload), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1 pg/mL; thrombosis/endothelial dysfunction) were included in this cross-sectional analysis (n=3,537 for hsCRP, tPA, NT-proBNP; n = 2,460 PAI-1). Adjusted means were estimated from linear regression models. All data was ascertained at study enrollment.
 
 
 Results:
 Controlling for age, race-ethnicity, history of stroke, heart failure, treated diabetes or hypertension, smoking, and postmenopausal hormone use, adjusted mean biomarker concentrations across incremental walking categories (0, >0-3.5, >3.5-8.33, >8.33 MET-hr/wk) were: hsCRP 4.1, 3.7, 3.2, 2.5, trend P<.001; NT-proBNP 162.9, 155.1, 148.2, 151.3, trend P=.05; tPA 8.9, 9.2, 8.3, 8.0, trend P=.01; PAI-1 16691, 16896, 15717, 14672, trend P<.001 (

 ). Similar patterns were observed across strenuous activity categories, aside from NT-proBNP. Across incremental categories of SB (<4.6, 4.6-8.5, >8.5 hr/day) positive associations were seen for adjusted mean hsCRP 3.4, 3.6, 3.9, trend P<.01; tPA 8.2, 8.9, 9.9, trend P=.03; PAI-1 15552, 16407, 16639, trend P=.05. In stratified analysis, inverse associations were observed regardless of comorbid status (prevalent diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, or cancer). Associations were attenuated but significant among older women, and associations of PA measures with hsCRP were stronger in those with high BMI (30+ kg/m
 2
 ).
 
 
 Conclusion:
 In this cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women, higher levels of walking and strenuous PA were associated with lower concentrations of biomarkers related to inflammation (hsCRP), fibrinolysis (tPA), and thrombosis/endothelial dysfunction (PAI-1), while higher SB was positively associated with elevated levels. The findings highlight the role of PA in promoting cardiovascular resiliency during aging, and underscore the adverse impact of prolonged SB.

Abstract 4145608: Calibration and Discrimination of Cardiovascular Risk Scores in Women with Breast Cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Women with breast cancer (BC) are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Currently, there is no standardized approach to assess CVD risk in women with BC, despite recommendations for risk assessment. We estimated and compared the performance of established ASCVD risk scores (Framingham Risk Score [FRS], Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease [ASCVD] Risk Estimator, and Life’s Essential 8 [LE8]) in a cohort of postmenopausal women with BC.
 
 
 Methods:
 Women who were diagnosed with BC (stage I-III) and free of CVD from the Women‘s Health Initiative were included in this study. The primary outcome was 10-year risk of ASCVD, defined as a composite of adjudicated coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. For each risk score, we examined calibration and discrimination. Calibration was assessed by calculating bias, slope, standard error of the estimate (SEE), and root mean square deviation (RMSD). Discordance was defined as the percent difference between expected and observed events. Discrimination was evaluated using the c-statistic. We reassessed calibration and discrimination after recalibrating the FRS and ASCVD scores.
 
 
 Results:
 In 6,946 participants (mean age BC diagnosis: 70 years; 89.7% White), the 10-year incidence of ASCVD was 8.6%. FRS underestimated ASCVD risk by 31.1%, whereas ASCVD and LE8 scores overestimated the risk by 53.7% and 9.3%, respectively (Hosmer-Lemeshow P<0.001 for all scores) (Figure). Discordance was consistent throughout the risk continuum for FRS and ASCVD. However, for LE8, discordance was minimal for those at moderate- to high- risk and overestimated in those at low-risk. The ASCVD risk score had the highest c-statistic of 0.76, compared to 0.62 and 0.71 for the FRS and LE8, respectively (Figure). After recalibration, the discordance for FRS and ASCVD was reduced where the FRS overestimated the risk by 3.7% and the ASCVD overestimated the risk by 37.3%. There were no changes in c-statistics.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this analysis, LE8 had the best calibration, whereas ASCVD had the best discrimination. The ASCVD risk score had a c-statistic of 0.76, suggesting it may be a practical tool to aid in 10-year CVD risk stratification in women with BC.

Abstract 6296: Biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular dysfunction in cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction: Cancer survival has increased in part due to treatment advances. However, anthracycline chemotherapy increases cardiovascular (CV) morbidity risk, including atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). Among those receiving anthracyclines, it is yet unclear who is at greatest risk of ASCVD, a major cause of CV mortality. Elucidating pathophysiologic processes involved in the development ASCVD could shed light on strategies to identify those at risk.
 Methods: Analyses were performed on 279 lymphoma and breast cancer survivors enrolled in the PREVENT study [clinical trial WF-98213) through Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Base (NCORP) and Alliance (A221501)]. CV dysfunction was measured via cardiac MRI (cMRI) at baseline (pre-treatment) and 6-months post-diagnosis to ascertain aortic distensibility and wall thickness in the descending aorta. Biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6-months and were log-transformed to base 2. Multiple linear regression was used to determine associations between biomarker and outcome at 6 months, adjusted for baseline biomarker and cMRI outcome, age, race, sex, body mass index, and smoking history.
 Results: The mean age (SD) of cancer survivors 49 (12) years; 92% were women. The mean aortic distensibility and mean wall thickness at baseline was 0.002 (0.0014) and 2.99 (0.41), respectively. Table 1 shows the associations between biomarkers and aortic distensibility and wall thickness of the descending aorta. After adjustment for confounders, Arginine, CRP, MPO, and ornithine were associated with 6-month aortic distensibility, and the HDL and SDMA were associated with aortic wall thickness.
 Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that biomarkers in oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways may be involved in pathophysiology of ASCVD among cancer survivors receiving anthracyclines. These results require further study in larger cohorts to better define mechanistic pathways involved.

Paper Title
Biomarkers of chronic inflammation and cognitive decline: A prospective observational study,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"We sought to determine whether the biomarkers of chronic inflammation predict cognitive decline in a prospective observational study. We measured baseline serum soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and high sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) levels in 282 participants of the University of Michigan Memory and Aging Project. Cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale for up to five time points. SuPAR and hs‐CRP levels were not significantly higher in participants with mild cognitive impairment (n = 97) or dementia (n = 59), compared to those with normal cognitive function (n = 126). Overall, 14% of participants experienced significant cognitive decline over the study period. The change in MoCA or CDR scores over time did not differ significantly according to baseline suPAR or hs‐CRP levels. Chronic systemic inflammation, as measured by serum suPAR or hs‐CRP levels, is unlikely to contribute significantly to cognitive decline."

Paper Title
Abstract 4137644: Association of Prolonged QTc with Development of Heart Failure after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Background:
 Use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) continues to rise in the United States, particularly in older age groups; however, HSCT is associated with various cardiovascular complications including heart failure (HF). We sought to examine whether prolonged QTc prior to HSCT was associated with the risk of HF post-HSCT.
 
 
 Methods:
 We used data from the Cardiovascular Registry in Bone Marrow Transplantation (CARE-BMT) study, a multicenter observational study of adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent autologous/allogeneic HSCT for malignant or nonmalignant bone marrow disorders at the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) between 2008-2019. In this analysis, only patients from the UMHS site were included (n=2,435). Baseline electrocardiogram (EKG) data were recorded prior to transplant (median (IQR) 14 (3, 30) days). QTc prolongation was defined per CTCAE grading criteria as Normal (<440ms), Grade 1 (440-480ms), and Grade ≥2 (>480ms). The primary outcome was new-onset HF defined as a diagnosis documented by health care providers after the date of hospitalization for HSCT. Analyses were conducted using a Fine-Gray model adjusted for the pre-HSCT CARE-BMT cardiovascular risk score.
 
 
 Results:
 Of the 2,435 patients (mean age at HSCT 55±13.4 years; 59.7% male; 90.5% White), 534 (21.9%) had long QTc pre-HSCT. Of those, 440 were Grade 1 and 94 were Grade ≥2. In all, 138 HF events occurred over median period of 2.3 (1.0-5.3) years. The 5-year cumulative incidence of HF was 5.0% in patients with normal QTc, 8.4% in patients with Grade 1 QTc prolongation, and 19.0% in patients with Grade ≥2 QTc prolongation (Figure). Patients with Grade 1 and Grade ≥2 prolongation had a 1.57 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.33) and 2.71 (95% CI: 1.51, 4.86) times higher risk of HF, respectively, compared to those with normal QTc.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this contemporary cohort of adult HSCT patients, those with QTc prolongation prior to HSCT had a higher incidence of HF compared to normal QTc, with greater degree of prolongation associated with higher risk. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the QTc as part of the pre-transplant cardiovascular evaluation

9-OR: ADA Presidents' Select Abstract: Targeting Inflammation with Salsalate in Type 1 Diabetes Neuropathy (TINSAL-T1DN Trial),

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Introduction & Objective: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) are highly prevalent complications of diabetes without effective disease-modifying treatments. Chronic inflammation and the NFkB pathway have emerged as important mechanisms. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of salsalate, a NFkB blocker, in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and DPN.
 Methods: This was a phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of salsalate 3 grams daily vs placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was the change in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) at the distal thigh at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included IENFD at distal leg, nerve conduction studies and measures of CAN (standardized cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests, heart rate variability). Linear regressions were used to assess percent changes in all outcomes between groups.
 Results: Fifty-five participants with T1D (mean age 51±12 years, baseline HbA1c 8.4±1.7%, duration 29±14 years) and mild to moderate DPN completed the trial. No significant differences were found in the primary outcome after 12 months. However, positive trends were noted in several secondary outcomes (salsalate vs placebo): sural amplitude (15% vs -10%; p=0.058), sural nerve conduction velocity (9% vs -4%; p=0.16), and measures of CAN (root mean square of the differences of successive RR intervals 34% vs 7%, expiration/inspiration ratio 6% vs -1%, and the 30:15 ratio 19% vs -5%) (p >0.05 for all). After adjusting for age, gender, diabetes duration, HbA1c, BMI, baseline IENFD at distal leg and thigh, sural amplitude significantly improved (31%; p= 0.031) with salsalate.
 Conclusion: In this small T1D cohort, salsalate treatment did not significantly change IENFD at distal thigh at 12 months. Trends toward improvement in the sural amplitude and other outcomes suggest salsalate’s potential as a disease-modifying therapy in T1D neuropathy, necessitating larger trials.

Increased myositis and possible myocarditis in melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the COVID-19 era,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Background Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-mediated myocarditis results in significant morbidity and mortality. At our institution, we noted an increased incidence of ICI-mediated myocarditis cases, leading to further investigation in our database of advanced melanoma patients treated with ICI therapy. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort analysis of patients with advanced melanoma identified cases of ICI-mediated myocarditis and myositis. Results 366 patients with advanced melanoma received a dose of ICI from September 2014 to October 2019. Of these patients, there were 0 cases of ICI-mediated myocarditis (0%, 95% CI 0%–1.0%) and 2 cases of ICI-mediated myositis (0.55%, 95% CI 0.07%–1.96%). From November 2019 to December 2021, an additional 246 patients with advanced melanoma were identified. Of these patients, 10 (4.1%, 95% CI 1.97%–7.35%) developed ICI-mediated myocarditis and 10 developed ICI-mediated myositis. Conclusion Our study suggests an increase in prevalence of ICI-mediated muscle damage including myositis and myocarditis in the COVID-19 era. Differentiation of these patients and further risk stratification may allow for development of guidelines for nuanced management of this serious complication.

Abstract 4125252: Pre-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Echocardiographic Indices and Post-Transplant Cardiovascular Outcomes,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with adverse cardiovascular (CV) events including the development of heart failure (HF) and arrythmias. While transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is routinely obtained prior to HSCT, its role in predicting the incidence of HSCT related CV events is poorly understood.
 
 
 Methods:
 We used data from the Cardiovascular Registry in Bone Marrow Transplantation (CARE-BMT) study, a multicenter observational study of adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent autologous/allogeneic HSCT for malignant or nonmalignant bone marrow disorders at the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and Rush University Medical Center from 2008-2019. In this analysis, we included patients from UMHS with a baseline TTE. Data on pre-HSCT TTE parameters and post-HSCT CV outcomes were collected through manual chart review. Left ventricular (LV) function and dimensions were categorized into normal, mildly abnormal, and moderately/severely abnormal based on American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. The primary outcomes were new-onset HF and atrial fibrillation/flutter post-HSCT. Analyses were conducted using a Fine-Gray model adjusted for the pre-HSCT CARE-BMT CV risk score.
 
 
 Results:
 Of the 2071 patients (mean age at HSCT 55.5
 +
 12.9 years; 59.5% male) with a pre-HSCT TTE (median 25 days pre-HSCT), 116 (5.6%) and 128 (6.2%) patients experienced HF and atrial fibrillation/flutter, respectively, over a median period of 2.2 years. Greater abnormalities in left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd) and end-systole (LVIDs) were linearly associated with a higher risk of HF (P-trend 0.018 and 0.004, respectively) (Table). Similarly, moderately/severely abnormal LVIDd was associated with a 2.41-fold (95% CI: 1.07, 5.43) increase in risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter (Table). Pre-HSCT ejection fraction (EF) was not associated with either endpoint.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 LV dilation, even when mild, was notably associated with increased risk of developing new HF or atrial arrythmias post-HSCT, regardless of EF. Whether evidence of LV dilation should prompt the initiation of guideline directed medical therapy to minimize the risk of incident HF warrants further study.

Abstract 4143186: Prior Statin Therapy Reduces Inflammation and Improves Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for Covid-19: A Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Statins are lipid-lowering agents with anti-inflammatory effects. Data surrounding the benefits of statins in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are conflicting. We sought to better understand the impact of statins in the context of Covid-19-related inflammation.
 
 
 Methods:
 We leveraged the International Study of Inflammation in Covid-19, a prospective multicenter cohort study of patients hospitalized specifically for Covid-19 between February 1, 2020 and October 30, 2022. Participants underwent systematic assessment of biomarkers of inflammation. We used logistic regression modeling and inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) to examine the association between prior statin use and the composite outcome of in-hospital death, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for renal replacement therapy.
 
 
 Results:
 A total of 4,464 patients were included in the study, of whom 1,364 (27.5%) were taking a statin prior to admission. There were 1,061 primary outcome events, including 540 deaths, 854 mechanical ventilation and 313 renal replacement therapy. Amongst biomarkers of inflammation, statin use was associated solely with lower levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) after adjusting for known confounders. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, statin use was associated with lower odds of the composite outcome (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.63, 95%CI[0.53-0.76]) compared to patients not on statins. Findings were consistent with IPTW (aOR 0.92, 95%CI [0.89- 0.95]). The proportion of the effect of statin on the primary outcome mediated by suPAR was estimated at 31.5%.
 
 
 Conclusion:
 Prior statin use is associated with improved outcomes and lower inflammation as measured by suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for Covid-19.

Paper Title
A Personalized, Texting-Based Conversational Agent to Address Sleep Disturbance in Individuals Who Have Survived Breast Cancer: Protocol for a Pilot Waitlist Randomized Controlled Trial,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Background Sleep disturbance is one of the most common health concerns reported by individuals who have survived breast cancer (BC) and is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and greater mortality after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) has shown efficacy for improving sleep and QoL for this population. Considered the gold standard for insomnia treatment, CBTi can be delivered remotely, including via digital intervention. Despite the potential for wider dissemination of CBTi via digital means, these modalities have unique challenges, including technology barriers and poor adherence. We developed a conversational agent (CA) to deliver CBTi via a SMS text messaging intervention, supported by mobile-ready web content. Named “Cecebot,” this CA delivers sleep education, implements sleep compression, provides just-in-time interventions for sleep-disrupting behaviors, and includes enhanced support for physical activity (PA) beyond what is typically included in CBTi. This represents a novel modality for a CBTi and PA intervention among individuals who have survived BC. Objective We aim to examine the safety and acceptability of the Cecebot intervention, developed by an academic partnership between Dr Reding’s research team and Moby Inc, for individuals who have survived BC and experience symptoms of insomnia, and to explore its efficacy. Methods This trial will recruit 60 individuals who have survived BC and are experiencing moderate to severe sleep disturbance. Participants will be assigned to the Cecebot intervention or waitlist control group at a 1:1 ratio. The treatment group will receive the Cecebot intervention during weeks 1-6 of the study, while the waitlist control condition will receive the Cecebot intervention during weeks 6-12. The Cecebot intervention uses SMS text messaging technology paired with a Fitbit. Participants will be assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Measurements will include feasibility and acceptability and will explore the effect of the Cecebot intervention. Feasibility will be assessed through recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates. Acceptability will be evaluated using a satisfaction survey and open-ended responses. Quantitative analysis, such as t test, Fisher exact tests, and generalized linear models, will be used to assess feasibility, baseline group differences, and the outcomes of the intervention. Results Recruitment of participants began in Fall 2024. The completion of data collection is anticipated to be by Fall 2025. Conclusions The study results will give insight into the potential for an SMS text messaging–based CA to improve sleep in individuals who have survived BC and experience sleep disturbances.

Paper Title
Obesity, Inflammation, and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"Abstract Context Obesity is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Objective The objective of this analysis was to determine whether inflammation mediates the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes. Methods The International Study of Inflammation in COVID-19 (ISIC): A Prospective Multi-Center Observational Study Examining the Role of Biomarkers of Inflammation in Predicting Covid-19 Related Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients, was conducted at 10 hospitals in the United States and Europe. Participants were adults hospitalized specifically for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, through October 19, 2022. Inflammatory biomarkers, including soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), were measured at admission. Associations were examined between body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and a composite of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy, stratified by pre- and post-Omicron variants. The contribution of inflammation to the relationship between obesity and outcomes was assessed. Results Among 4644 participants (mean age 59.3, 45.6% male, 21.8% BMI ≥ 35), those with BMI > 40 (n = 485) had 55% higher odds of the composite outcome (95% CI, 1.21-1.98) compared with nonobese individuals (BMI < 30, n = 2358) in multivariable analysis. In multiple mediation analysis, only suPAR remained a significant mediator between BMI and composite outcome. Associations were amplified for participants younger than 65 years and with pre-Omicron variants. Conclusion Obesity is associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19, notably in younger participants and in the pre-Omicron era. Inflammation, as measured by suPAR, is a significant mediator of the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes."

Paper Title
The relationship between cardiometabolic abnormalities and mortality among women with and without cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"e24007 Background: Prior studies of women with obesity-associated cancers in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) showed higher overall and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) for women with a higher number of cardiometabolic risk factors at baseline. It is unclear if this risk differs from women without cancer. In order to determine if this relationship differs among both groups, we compared the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality among women in the WHI with and without cancer. Methods: Women with one of five early-stage obesity-associated cancers (breast, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and matched controls without history of cancer, were selected from the WHI-Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC) study. Cardiometabolic risk factors included high waist circumference (WC) (≥88 cm), systemic hypertension ( > 130/85 mm Hg) measured at study visits, and self-reported history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (all-cause mortality) and Fine-Gray models (CVD and non-CVD mortality) were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate the association between baseline cardiometabolic risk factors and survival outcomes for the cancer and non-cancer cohorts in separate models. Sensitivity analyses included women in the cancer-cohort who received cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Results: A total of 7,491 and 35,508 women were analyzed in the cancer and non-cancer cohorts respectively. CVD was the most common cause of death (excluding cancer) in both non-cancer (41.4%) and cancer (41.5%) cohorts. Adjusted Cox models showed that the proportion of deaths due to any cause, by number of cardiometabolic risk factors, was significantly higher in the non-cancer compared to the cancer cohort (p-value = 0.02), with the HR values being higher for those with 3-4 risk factors compared to 1-2. Similar results were seen for each individual risk factor except for WC. Regarding CVD and non-CVD mortality, in competing risks models, there were no significant differences in the risk of death by number of risk factors, between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts (p = 0.21 and 0.22) respectively. Sensitivity analyses for women who received a cardiotoxic regimen, (81.5% anthracyclines alone, 13.4% anti-HER2 alone, and 5.1% both) showed no differences in the results for all-cause mortality, and CVD mortality. However, for non-CVD mortality, the proportion of deaths was significantly higher for women in the non-cancer cohort (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Cardiometabolic risk factors had a greater impact on mortality among women without cancer compared to those with cancer, except for death due to CVD which was similar between groups, suggesting that CVD risk reducing interventions are of equal importance for women with and without cancer."

Paper Title
Low physical function Post-Cancer diagnosis is associated with higher mortality risk in postmenopausal women.,

Year
2024,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Postmenopausal women with cancer experience an accelerated physical dysfunction beyond that expected through aging alone due to cancer and its treatments. The aim of this study is to determine whether declines in physical function after cancer diagnosis are associated with all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality.


METHODS
This prospective cohort study included 8,068 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) who were diagnosed with cancer and had physical function assessed within 1-year of cancer diagnosis. Self-reported physical function was measured using the 10-item physical function subscale of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Cause of death was determined by medical record review with central adjudication and linkage to the National Death Index. Death was adjudicated through February 2022.


RESULTS
Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years from cancer diagnosis 3,316 (41.1%) women died. Our results showed that for every 10% decline in the physical function score after cancer diagnosis, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were significantly reduced by 12% (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.89) and (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.86 to 0.91), respectively. Further categorical analyses showed a significant dose-response relationship between post-diagnosis physical function categories and mortality outcomes (trend test P < .001), where the median survival time for women in the lowest physical function quartile was 9.1 (8.6, 10.6) years compared to 18.4 (15.8, 22.0) years for women in the highest physical function quartile.


CONCLUSION
Postmenopausal women with low physical function after cancer diagnosis may be at higher risk of mortality from all causes and cancer-related mortality."

Paper Title
20-LB: Impact of Optimal Medical Therapy, Insulin Sensitization, and Revascularization Strategies on Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Its Association with Cardiovascular Outcomes—A BARI-2D Ancillary Study,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a driver of its complications. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is an immune-derived signaling glycoprotein involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related outcomes, notably atherosclerosis and nephropathy. We aimed to determine if optimal medical therapy, insulin sensitization, and revascularization strategy impact suPAR levels and modulate its association with outcomes. We leveraged the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI-2D) trial, a study of patients with T2D and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent either revascularization or optimized medical therapy, and were randomized to either insulin-sensitization or insulin-provision therapy. We measured plasma suPAR levels in 2316 patients at baseline and 1-year follow-up and examined the association between suPAR and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The median suPAR level at baseline was 3.02 ng/ml (IQR 2.32-3.95) and 3.15 ng/ml (2.4-4.2) at 1-year. SuPAR levels were notably higher in patients who underwent CABG (2.94 vs 2.70, p<0.001), but were unchanged post-PCI, insulin sensitization or insulin provisioning at 1 year. In multivariable analyses, baseline and 1-years suPAR levels were predictive of MACE, without difference in the strengths of the association between the two time points (HR of 2.18 (95%CI[1.57-3.03]) at baseline and 2.13 (95%CI[1.45-3.13]) at follow-up for the 3rd tertile compared to the first. Our findings suggest that inflammation as measured by suPAR is not reduced by revascularization or T2D treatment strategy, and likely accounts for the residual CV risk in patients with T2D. The advent of anti-suPAR therapies may offer new promise for patients with T2D and co-morbid CAD.

Paper Title
Estimating burden of cardiovascular disease among survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer in the detroit research on cancer survivors (ROCS) cohort.,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"12082 Background: With new advances in cancer treatment, cancer-specific mortality has decreased by 31% over the past 3 decades. The growing number of cancer survivors has led to increased risk of other chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has become an important competing cause of mortality. This study evaluates the incidence of CVD, including heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke after cancer in the Detroit ROCS cohort. Methods: ROCS is an African American cancer survivorship cohort that enrolled participants residing in the tri-county Detroit Metropolitan area. This study included survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer who provided socio-demographic and clinic information on self-administered questionnaires. We calculated incidence as percentages and rates per 1,000 person-years of HF, MI, CAD, AF, and stroke after cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between socio-demographic and clinical predictors of CVD by using factors with p-value < 0.1. Results: After excluding patients with pre-existing CVD or lack of data on comorbidities, the study cohort consisted of 2,865 participants. The mean (SD) age at cancer diagnosis was 60.3 (9.4) years with median follow up of 3.0 (1.0-9.3) years. The incidence rate for any CVD was 23.3 per 1,000 person-years. In the study sample, stroke was the leading CVD, followed by HF, AF, CAD and MI. Lung cancer survivors had the highest incidence of CVD followed by prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer. Age at cancer diagnosis, household income, insurance, aspirin, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol were included in the final model. In the multivariate analysis, decreased household income [OR 1.26 (95% CI 1.05-1.52)], prior aspirin use [OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.34-2.49)], and history of hypertension [OR 1.71 (95% CI 1.20-2.44)] were associated with higher odds of CVD. Conclusions: CVD is a relatively common outcome within years after cancer diagnosis in an African American survivorship cohort. Intervention should focus on the possible impact of socioeconomic variables and control of hypertension in reducing the risk of CVD after cancer. [Table: see text]"

Paper Title
Cardiovascular Risk Stratification of Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: The CARE‐BMT Risk Score,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Background Evidence guiding the pre‐hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) cardiovascular evaluation is limited. We sought to derive and validate a pre‐HSCT score for the cardiovascular risk stratification of HSCT candidates. Methods and Results We leveraged the CARE‐BMT (Cardiovascular Registry in Bone Marrow Transplantation) study, a contemporary multicenter observational study of adult patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT between 2008 and 2019 (N=2435; mean age at transplant of 55 years; 4.9% Black). We identified the subset of variables most predictive of post‐HSCT cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and sustained ventricular tachycardia. We then developed a point‐based risk score using the hazard ratios obtained from Cox proportional hazards modeling. The score was externally validated in a separate cohort of 919 HSCT recipients (mean age at transplant 54 years; 20.4% Black). The risk score included age, transplant type, race, coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, creatinine, triglycerides, and prior anthracycline dose. Risk scores were grouped as low‐, intermediate‐, and high‐risk, with the 5‐year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events being 4.0%, 10.3%, and 22.4%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating curves for predicting cardiovascular events at 100 days, 5 and 10 years post‐HSCT were 0.65 (95% CI, 0.59–0.70), 0.73 (95% CI, 0.69–0.76), and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69–0.81), respectively. The model performed equally well in autologous and allogeneic recipients, as well as in the validation cohort. Conclusions The CARE‐BMT risk score is easy to calculate and could help guide referrals of high‐risk HSCT recipients to cardiovascular specialists before transplant and guide long‐term monitoring."

Paper Title
Abstract B014: Income level associated with death from cardiovascular disease after breast cancer in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"
 Introduction: Breast cancer (BC) treatment has known cardiotoxic effects. While increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) after BC has been demonstrated in select racial/ethnic minorities, less is known about the association of social determinants of health (SDH) variables on death from CVD after BC treatment. Methods: Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative, we examined factors associated with increased risk of death from CVD after BC diagnosis among 8,728 women (n=7,433 non-Hispanic White (NHW); n=706 non-Hispanic, Black (NHB); n=288 Hispanic, n=271 non-Hispanic Asian; n=30 missing racial information) . Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the relationship between survival outcomes (death due to BC, death due to CVD, and adjudicated CVD after BC) and race/ethnicity and income. Income level was stratified into less than $35,000, $35,000-$74,999, and greater than or equal to $75,000. Results: Income level less than $35,000 was associated with a significantly increased risk of death due to CVD after BC (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.84) compared to income between $35,000 and $74,999. Income greater than $75,000 was associated with a significantly less risk of death due to CVD after BC (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.71).  A higher cumulative incidence of death from BC and death from CVD was associated with the lowest income bracket. Furthermore, death from CVD surpassed death from BC around 13 years after BC diagnosis for income levels less than $35,000 and at 20 years after BC diagnosis for those with income levels between $35,000 and $74.999. However, for the highest income bracket of greater than $75,000, death from CVD never surpassed cumulative incidence of death from BC. Hispanic women were less likely to have death due to CVD after BC compared to NHW women (HR=0.10; 95% CI:0.49,0.77). No significant difference in death from CVD was seen between NHW and NHB women. Among NHW women, those with income less than $35,000 had higher likelihood of death from CVD (HR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.84), compared to those with income between $35,000 and $74,999. NHW women with greater than $75,000 had a less likely chance of dying compared to those with income between $35,000 and $74,999 (HR=0.61; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77). A difference in death due to CVD across income levels was not observed among NHB women. However, among Hispanic women with less than $35,000 annual income, a 10- fold increased risk of death from CVD was observed compared to Hispanic women with annual income $35,000-$74,999 (HR=10.41; 95% CI 1.43, 75.57). Conclusion: In the WHI, income level was strongly associated with increased risk of death from CVD after BC, especially among NHW and Hispanic women, but not among NHB women. Clinical trials investigating therapies with potential cardiotoxic effects must include patients with diverse income levels to prevent potentially exacerbating BC disparities.

Paper Title
A review of research on the intersection between breast cancer and cardiovascular research in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI),

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Both obesity and metabolic syndrome are linked to increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers of the breast (post-menopausal), and other obesity-related cancers. Over the past 50 years, the worldwide prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome has increased, with a concomitant higher incidence of associated co-morbidities and mortality. The precise mechanism linking metabolic syndrome to increased cancer incidence is incompletely understood, however, individual components of metabolic syndrome have been linked to increased breast cancer incidence and worse survival. There is a bidirectional relationship between the risk of CVD and cancer due to a high burden of shared risk factors and higher rates of CVD among cancer survivors, which may be impacted by the pro-inflammatory microenvironment associated with metabolic syndrome and cancer-directed therapies. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) is an excellent resource to study a dual relationship between cancer and CVD (cardio-oncology) with extensive information on risk factors and long-term outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of research on cardio-oncology conducted utilizing WHI data with focus on studies evaluating both breast cancer and CVD including shared risk factors and outcomes after cancer. The review also includes results on other obesity related cancers which were included in the analyses of breast cancer, articles looking at cancer after heart disease (reverse cardio-oncology) and the role of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) as a shared risk factor between CVD and cancer. A summary of pertinent WHI literature helps to delineate the direction of future research evaluating the relationship between CVD and other cancer sites, and provides information on the opportunity for other novel analyses within the WHI."

487-P: Cardiovascular Autonomic Function in Long COVID-19 Individuals With and Without Diabetes,

Year
2023,

Abstract
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a broad spectrum of long-term complications. These include the development and progression of severe autonomic dysfunction, particularly among people with diabetes. We evaluated cardiovascular autonomic (CAN) function in a cross-sectional study in 47 adults with long COVID-19 with (N=21, mean age 61 years, 43% women, mean A1c 6.2%) and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (N=26, mean age 58 years, 65% women) and compared them with T2DM without COVID-19 (N=45, mean age 57 years, 42% women, mean A1c 7.8%). CAN was assessed with cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (30:15 ratio, E.I ratio, Valsalva ratio) and indices of heart rate variability (SDNN, RMSSD). We used pairwise comparison and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) both adjusted for age, gender, race, and BMI to compare the groups. In a pairwise comparison higher heart rate (HR) and lower CAN measures (SDNN, RMSSD, Valsalva) were found in T2DM with COVID-19 compared to T2DM without COVID-19. Lower HR and lower Valsalva were found in COVID-19 individuals without T2DM compared to T2DM without COVID-19. When comparing the three groups, lower Valsalva were found in COVID-19 individuals with and without T2DM compared to T2DM without COVID-19 (Figure). These data suggest that COVID-19 exacerbates CAN in patients with T2DM and impacts CAN in people without T2DM at a magnitude similar to that of T2DM patients.

Paper Title
Associations of Health-Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance With Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Breast cancer (BC) survivors are at an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD), often attributed to cancer treatment. However, cancer treatment may also negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a risk factor of CVD in the general population. Objective We examined whether sleep disturbance, and physical or mental HRQoL were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative of postmenopausal women given a diagnosis of invasive BC during follow-up through 2010 with no history of CVD before BC. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke, after BC. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the Short-Form 36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and sleep disturbance, measured by the Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, were recorded post BC. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring and adjusted for relevant confounders. Results In 2884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher Physical Component Summary scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.99]; per 5-point increment in Physical Component Summary). No associations with CVD were found for Mental Component Summary or Insomnia Rating Scale. Conclusion In BC survivors, poor physical HRQoL is a significant predictor of CVD. Implications for Practice Our findings highlight the importance for nurses to assess and promote physical HRQoL as part of a holistic approach to mitigating the risk of CVD in BC survivors."

Paper Title
Inflammation, Hyperglycemia, and Adverse Outcomes in Individuals With Diabetes Mellitus Hospitalized for COVID-19.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for reasons that are unclear.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We leveraged the International Study of Inflammation in COVID-19 (ISIC), a multicenter observational study of 2,044 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, to characterize the impact of DM on in-hospital outcomes and assess the contribution of inflammation and hyperglycemia to the risk attributed to DM. We measured biomarkers of inflammation collected at hospital admission and collected glucose levels and insulin data throughout hospitalization. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital death, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for renal replacement therapy.


RESULTS
Among participants (mean age 60 years, 58.2% males), those with DM (n = 686, 33.5%) had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of the primary outcome (37.8% vs. 28.6%) and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers than those without DM. Among biomarkers, DM was only associated with higher soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels in multivariable analysis. Adjusting for suPAR levels abrogated the association between DM and the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.23 [95% CI 0.78, 1.37]). In mediation analysis, we estimated the proportion of the effect of DM on the primary outcome mediated by suPAR at 84.2%. Hyperglycemia and higher insulin doses were independent predictors of the primary outcome, with effect sizes unaffected by adjusting for suPAR levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that the association between DM and outcomes in COVID-19 is largely mediated by hyperinflammation as assessed by suPAR levels, while the impact of hyperglycemia is independent of inflammation."

Paper Title
Increased incidence of immune-mediated myocarditis in advanced skin malignancies treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the COVID-19 era.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"2664 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of advanced stage skin malignancies. Immunotherapy related adverse events (irAE) are toxicities associated with ICI therapy. Myocarditis is a rare life-threatening irAE. We attempt to characterize cases of myocarditis related to ICI therapy that have occurred since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort analysis of patients with advanced stage skin cancers who were treated with ICIs and identified cases of ICI-mediated myocarditis. ICI-mediated myocarditis was defined as evidence of myocardial injury in the setting of irAEs and exclusion of cardiovascular causes. Clinicopathologic variables and clinical outcomes were assessed in these patients. Results:A review of 361 patients that received ICI from 9/2014 – 10/2019 found 0 cases of ICI-mediated myocarditis. From 11/2019 – 12/2021, an additional 425 patients were identified of whom 11 (2.6%) developed ICI-mediated myocarditis. 10 patients had melanoma and 1 patient had Merkel cell carcinoma. 10/11 patients were male. 9/11 were treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and 2/11 were treated with ipilimumab with nivolumab. All patients had elevated high sensitivity troponin (median 361 pg/mL on presentation, reference range 0-19 pg/mL). 11/11 patients presented with elevated CPK (median 1734 IU/L, reference range 38-240 IU/L) and 8/11 presented with elevated AST:ALT ratio (median 1.58:1) on routine screening which prompted further investigation. 1 patient tested positive for COVID-19 13 days after initial biochemical concern for myocarditis, and 5 patients had received COVID-19 vaccines between 2.5-11 months prior to myocarditis onset. All patients were treated with high dose steroids, and 4 were treated with abatacept. 2 patients died within 30 days after diagnosis of myocarditis and 2 patients later died from malignancy progression. 2 patients developed progressive disease and 1 was successfully rechallenged with ICI with no myocarditis recurrence. 2 patients remain on active surveillance, 2 continue on a steroid taper, and 1 was lost to follow up. All patients with at least 5 months of follow up from myocarditis onset (n = 5) had persistently elevated HS-troponin despite normalization of CPK levels. Conclusions: In this single center study, we noted an increase in the frequency of ICI-mediated myocarditis in patients with advanced skin cancers during the pandemic era (2.6% vs 0% pre-pandemic) which is higher than reported in the literature (0.04-1.14%). The impact of COVID-19 during this time is suspicious and warrants further investigation. Therefore, we suggest heightened awareness in the COVID-19 era that elevated CPK levels and AST:ALT ratios merits further diagnostic investigation of ICI-mediated myocarditis."

Paper Title
Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor and Venous Thromboembolism in COVID‐19,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) contributes significantly to COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality. The urokinase receptor system is involved in the regulation of coagulation. Levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) reflect hyperinflammation and are strongly predictive of outcomes in COVID‐19. Whether suPAR levels identify patients with COVID‐19 at risk for VTE is unclear. Methods and Results We leveraged a multinational observational study of patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 with suPAR and D‐dimer levels measured on admission. In 1960 patients (mean age, 58 years; 57% men; 20% Black race), we assessed the association between suPAR and incident VTE (defined as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) using logistic regression and Fine‐Gray modeling, accounting for the competing risk of death. VTE occurred in 163 (8%) patients and was associated with higher suPAR and D‐dimer levels. There was a positive association between suPAR and D‐dimer (β=7.34; P=0.002). Adjusted for clinical covariables, including D‐dimer, the odds of VTE were 168% higher comparing the third with first suPAR tertiles (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68 [95% CI, 1.51–4.75]; P<0.001). Findings were consistent when stratified by D‐dimer levels and in survival analysis accounting for death as a competing risk. On the basis of predicted probabilities from random forest, a decision tree found the combined D‐dimer <1 mg/L and suPAR <11 ng/mL cutoffs, identifying 41% of patients with only 3.6% VTE probability. Conclusions Higher suPAR was associated with incident VTE independently of D‐dimer in patients hospitalized for COVID‐19. Combining suPAR and D‐dimer identified patients at low VTE risk.

Paper Title
Relationship Between Preexisting Cardiovascular Disease and Death and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background: Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) is perceived as a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We sought to determine whether CVD is associated with in-hospital death and cardiovascular events in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study used data from a multicenter cohort of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units at 68 centers across the United States from March 1 to July 1, 2020. The primary exposure was CVD, defined as preexisting coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or atrial fibrillation/flutter. Myocardial injury on intensive care unit admission defined as a troponin I or T level above the 99th percentile upper reference limit of normal was a secondary exposure. The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events (cardiac arrest, new-onset arrhythmias, new-onset heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, or stroke) within 14 days. Results: Among 5133 patients (3231 male [62.9%]; mean age 61 years [SD, 15]), 1174 (22.9%) had preexisting CVD. A total of 1178 (34.6%) died, and 920 (17.9%) had a cardiovascular event. After adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, history of smoking, and comorbidities, preexisting CVD was associated with a 1.15 (95% CI, 0.98–1.34) higher odds of death. No independent association was observed between preexisting CVD and cardiovascular events. Myocardial injury on intensive care unit admission was associated with higher odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.61–2.31]) and cardiovascular events (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.47–2.24]), regardless of the presence of CVD. Conclusions: CVD risk factors, rather than CVD itself, were the major contributors to outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The occurrence of myocardial injury, regardless of CVD, and its association with outcomes suggests it is likely due to multiorgan injury related to acute inflammation rather than exacerbation of preexisting CVD.

LVEF decline in relation to body composition among women treated for breast cancer: WF-97415.,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"10556 Background: Despite an improvement in survival from breast cancer (BC), many women experience cardiotoxicity. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced by an average of 9.7% in women receiving anthracyclines. Obesity and central adiposity at BC diagnosis may influence risk of LVEF decline. We sought to examine associations between body composition and LVEF decline in the UPBEAT (Understanding and Predicting Fatigue, Cardiovascular Decline, and Events After Breast Cancer: WF-97415) study, which was conducted in collaboration with NCI Community Oncology Research Program. Methods: The analytic cohort was comprised of 167 women treated for stage I-III BC with chemotherapy and/or radiation in the UPBEAT prospective study, in whom LVEF was obtained at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3 months. Linear regression was used to examine LVEF decline in relation to 1) waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and 2) changes in WC and BMI during BC treatment. All models were adjusted for age and race. Results: In this cohort (mean [SD] age: 55.7 [10.8] yrs; in whom 75% were white; 19% were Black), the mean (SD) LVEF at baseline was 60.7 (6.7)% with a mean decline of 2.7 (7.2)% from baseline to 3-months. Both WC and BMI at BC diagnosis were associated with LVEF decline during follow-up (Table). For each additional inch in WC, EF decreased by 0.25% points at 3 months (P=0.024); for each additional kg/m2 in BMI, EF decreased by 0.2% points at 3 months (P=0.007). Reduced BMI during treatment was associated with LVEF decline, whereas a change in WC was not. Each kg/m2 reduction in BMI was associated with a 0.4% point decrease in LVEF (p=0.037). Anthracycline use was associated with a 1.89% point decline in LVEF at 3 months versus non-users (p=0.049). After additional adjustment for anthracycline use, baseline WC remained statistically significantly associated with LVEF decline to the same degree. Conclusions: These data show that central adiposity at BC diagnosis is associated with LVEF decline during treatment, even after controlling for anthracyclines. Loss of central adiposity was not associated with LVEF decline, whereas BMI loss during treatment was. This suggests that shifts in body composition during BC treatment, potentially via loss of muscle mass, are important to monitor in patients. Future work should examine how changes in body composition, particularly changes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue depots, influence cardiac dysfunction in BC patients during treatment.

Paper Title
Retrospective Evaluation of Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin Induction in Heart Transplant Patients,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background. The dosing intensity of antithymocyte globulin as induction therapy in heart transplantation remains controversial. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rabbit antithymocyte globulin at a total dose of 4.5 mg/kg compared with <4.5 mg/kg. Methods. This was a retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation from January 2016 to December 2018 at a single quaternary care center. Exposure was defined as full antithymocyte globulin (4.5 mg/kg total) induction compared with partial (<4.5 mg/kg) induction. The primary outcome was the incidence of The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 1990 acute cellular rejection grade 2 or above at 2 y. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, number of infections, and time to therapeutic tacrolimus levels. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare rejection rates and mortality. Results. Of 201 patients, 61 received partial and 140 received full induction. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of cellular rejection grade 2 or above (18% versus 11.4%, P = 0.209) within 2 y. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.45 (confidence interval: 0.62-3.37, P = 0.388) for partial compared with full induction for any grade rejection. Landmark survival analysis conditional on survival to 1 mo showed no difference in mortality (P = 0.239). There was no difference in the incidence of infection within 3 mo of transplant (partial 29.5% versus full 20.0%, P = 0.140). Both groups achieved therapeutic tacrolimus levels by day 7 after initiation. Conclusions. There was no difference in overall risk for any grade cellular rejection between partial or full dose induction therapy. Additionally, there was no difference in medium-term mortality from landmark survival analysis."

Abstract 12324: Biomarker Trends in Patients With Immune-Checkpoint Inhibitor Myocarditis,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with myocarditis; however, there is no consensus on strategies to identify or monitor for myocarditis. We sought to characterize longitudinal biomarkers in patients receiving ICIs.
 
 
 Methods:
 We conducted an observational cohort study of adult (≥18 years) patients who had received at least one dose of single or dual ICI at Michigan Medicine between June 2014 - December 2021. Patients were identified as having myocarditis if a clinical diagnosis was noted in the medical record by the cardiovascular consult team. Laboratory values (i.e., high-sensitivity troponin-T [hsTnT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatinine phosphokinase [CPK]) were collected from medical records for 12 months after beginning ICI.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,606 patients (mean (SD) age 64 (13) years; 60.8% male), 27 (1.0%) developed myocarditis at a median (IQR) time of 28 (18,40) days after starting ICIs. At diagnosis, most patients with myocarditis had a non-cardiac immune-related adverse event (88.9%) and an elevated ALT (88.9%), AST (85.2%), CPK (88.9%), and LDH (92.6%). All patients with myocarditis had an elevated hsTnT. Compared to patients without myocarditis, patients with myocarditis had significant elevations in ALT, AST, CPK, and LDH after starting ICIs (all P<0.001) (Figure). In patients with myocarditis, average concentrations of AST and ALT remained elevated at 12 months, whereas CPK peaked at 1 month then rapidly declined. Average concentrations of all biomarkers in patients without myocarditis were in the normal range. CPK values greater than the upper limit of normal had a sensitivity and specificity of detecting myocarditis of 99% and 23%, respectively.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 Myocarditis rarely occurs in the absence of other immune-related adverse events. Elevated AST, ALT and CPK should prompt measuring hs-TnT and initiating further evaluation for ICI myocarditis.

Paper Title
Abstract 13185: Incidence and Risk Factors of Acute Cardiovascular Complications After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with various cardiovascular (CV) complications. Due to the lack of recent large cohort studies, the incidence and clinical determinants of acute HSCT-related CV events are ill-defined.
 
 
 Methods:
 We conducted a multi-center observational study (University of Michigan and Rush University) of adult (≥18 years) patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT for malignant or non-malignant bone marrow disorders from 2005-2021. Data on demographics, pre-HSCT clinical characteristics, imaging, laboratory findings, and acute (<100 days post-HSCT) CV outcomes were collected through manual chart review. The primary outcome was defined as a composite of death from CV cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, new-onset heart failure (HF), new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation/flutter, or sustained ventricular tachycardia.
 
 
 Results:
 Of 4,262 included patients (mean age at HSCT 56±14 years; 59% male; 82% White), 161 (3.8%) patients experienced an acute CV event (153 events/1,000 person-years). Compared to patients without a CV event, those who developed a CV event were older, had greater burden of CV comorbidities including HF, more likely to be on antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin, and had higher B-type natriuretic peptide and lower high-density lipoprotein pre-HSCT (Table). Pre-HSCT ejection fraction and prior anthracycline exposure were not associated with acute CV events.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In the largest cotemporary cohort of adult HSCT patients to date, acute CV events occurred in <5% of patients. Events were more common in older patients with CV comorbidities. highlighting the potential need for improving the pre-HSCT CV risk stratification. The major limitation of this study is the retrospective nature and accompanying selection bias. Future prospective studies should assess evidence-based strategies for risk-stratifying HSCT patients.

Paper Title
Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists and Heart Failure Risk in Postmenopausal Women: The Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Prior studies suggested lower risk of heart failure (HF) in individuals taking H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) compared with H2RA nonusers in relatively small studies. We evaluated the association of H2RA use and incident HF in postmenopausal women in the large‐scale WHI (Women’s Health Initiative) study. Methods and Results This study included postmenopausal women from the WHI without a history of HF at baseline. HF was defined as first incident hospitalization for HF and physician adjudicated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated the association of H2RA use as a time‐varying exposure with HF risk, after adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and medical history variables. Sensitivity analyses examined (1) risk of HF stratified by the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) score, (2) propensity score matching on H2RA use, (3) use of proton pump inhibitors rather than H2RA nonuse as the referent, and (4) exclusion of those taking diuretics at baseline. The primary analysis included 158 854 women after exclusion criteria, of whom 9757 (6.1%) were H2RA users. During median 8.2 years of follow‐up, 376 H2RA users (4.9 events/1000 person‐years) and 3206 nonusers (2.7 events/1000 person‐years) developed incident HF. After multivariable adjustment, there was no association between H2RA use and HF in the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94–1.22; P=0.31) or in any of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Clinical H2RA use was not associated with incident HF among postmenopausal women. Future studies are needed to evaluate potential effect modification by sex, HF severity, or patterns of use on H2RA exposure and HF risk.

Paper Title
Inflammatory, Oxidative Stress, and Cardiac Damage Biomarkers and Radiation-Induced Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Purpose Studies examining biomarkers associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation are limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-breast cancer fatigue in survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine, myeloperoxidase; [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I. Methods In a secondary analysis, we included participants from the Women’s Health Initiative if they had: a previous breast cancer diagnosis (stages I-III), no prior cardiovascular diseases, pre-and post-breast cancer serum samples drawn approximately 3 years apart, and fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 vitality subscale at both serum collections. Biomarkers were measured using ELISA or RT-qPCR and modeled as the log2 post-to pre-breast cancer ratio. Results Overall, 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) years were included. The mean (SD) vitality scores were 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-breast cancer, respectively. Using multivariable weighted linear regression, higher biomarker ratios of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were associated with a lower vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue). For example, for each 2-fold difference in cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: −14.2, −0.45). Conclusion Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with fatigue in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation; however, these findings should be replicated in a larger sample. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or assessed in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for fatigue."

Paper Title
Increased soluble urokinase plasminogen activator levels modulate monocyte function to promote atherosclerosis,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"People with kidney disease are disproportionately affected by atherosclerosis for unclear reasons. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is an immune-derived mediator of kidney disease, levels of which are strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes. We assessed suPAR’s pathogenic involvement in atherosclerosis using epidemiologic, genetic, and experimental approaches. We found serum suPAR levels to be predictive of coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular events in 5,406 participants without known coronary disease. In a genome-wide association meta-analysis including over 25,000 individuals, we identified a missense variant in the plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (PLAUR) gene (rs4760), confirmed experimentally to lead to higher suPAR levels. Mendelian randomization analysis in the UK Biobank using rs4760 indicated a causal association between genetically predicted suPAR levels and atherosclerotic phenotypes. In an experimental model of atherosclerosis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin–9 (Pcsk9) transfection in mice overexpressing suPAR (suPARTg) led to substantially increased atherosclerotic plaques with necrotic cores and macrophage infiltration compared with those in WT mice, despite similar cholesterol levels. Prior to induction of atherosclerosis, aortas of suPARTg mice excreted higher levels of CCL2 and had higher monocyte counts compared with WT aortas. Aortic and circulating suPARTg monocytes exhibited a proinflammatory profile and enhanced chemotaxis. These findings characterize suPAR as a pathogenic factor for atherosclerosis acting at least partially through modulation of monocyte function."

Paper Title
Associations of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and cardiac damage biomarkers and radiation-induced fatigue in breast cancer survivors.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"191 Background: Radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) is common in breast cancer (BC) survivors and can last years after treatment. Despite the known physiological consequences of radiation, information on biomarkers of RIF is limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-BC fatigue in BC survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), myeloperoxidase (MPO); [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor (PGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B); [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I (TnI). Methods: In an ancillary study in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), participants with incident BC (stages I-III) treated with radiation were followed for the development of fatigue post-BC. Women were eligible if they 1) had no prior cardiovascular disease and 2) had pre-and post-BC serum samples drawn approximately three years apart with fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) vitality subscale at the same times. Biomarkers were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Higher SF-36 vitality scores correspond to lesser fatigue. Weighted linear regression adjusted for relevant demographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors, as well as pre-cancer fatigue. Each biomarker was modeled as the post-BC to pre-BC ratio and log transformed to base 2, thus, the effect estimates correspond to a doubling in value compared to pre-BC. Results: A total of 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) were included. The mean (SD) vitality score was 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-BC, respectively. The median (IQR) time between pre-BC serum collection to BC was 1.9 (0.8, 2.6) years and 1.4 (0.7, 2.3) years between BC and the post-BC serum collection. After adjustment, a higher biomarker ratio of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were all associated with a lower SF-36 vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue) (Table). As an example, for a 2-fold difference in the cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the SF-36 vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: -14.2, -0.45). Conclusions: Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with RIF in BC survivors. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or be included in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for RIF. [Table: see text]"

Abstract 9092: Association of Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cardiac Damage with Long-Term Radiation-Induced Cardiovascular Outcomes in Breast Cancer,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Radiation therapy (RT) is a common component of breast cancer (BC) management, but may be associated with radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD) which includes coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, CVD death, heart failure, or stroke. We examined associations of biomarkers of oxidative stress (MPO, GDF-15, 8-OH-dG, PGF), cardiac injury (TnI, Cystatin-C), inflammation (IL-6, CRP), and myocardial fibrosis (TGF-B) with long-term RICVD in BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 In an ancillary, nested case-control study within the Women’s Health Initiative, postmenopausal women with incident BC stages I-III, who received RT, and had pre- and post-BC diagnosis serum samples available not more than 3 years apart were eligible. Cases were defined as developing incident, physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, CVD death, heart failure, or stroke after BC. Each case was matched to 3 controls on enrollment age and visit year of pre-BC blood draw. Biomarkers were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and modeled as the post-BC to pre-BC ratio and log transformed to base 2. Logistic regression models were adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and cancer characteristics.
 
 
 Results:
 A total of 55 cases and 158 controls were included with a mean (SD) age of 66.9 (5.5) years and a median (IQR) time from BC diagnosis to post-BC serum collection of 1.4 (0.7, 2.4) years. After adjustment, a higher 8-OH-dG ratio was significantly associated with an elevated risk of RICVD (Table). For a doubling in the biomarker ratio, RICVD risk was 3.04-fold higher (95% CI: 1.01, 9.21). Other biomarkers were not associated with RICVD risk.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In this study, higher concentrations of 8-OH-dG were associated with a higher risk of RICVD. This suggests that oxidative DNA damage may be a putative pathway for delayed RICVD. However, given the sample size and multiple testing, further studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings.

Abstract 11147: Associations of Physical and Mental-Health Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance with Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Post-Menopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and greater sleep disturbance (SD) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. However, these associations may differ in breast cancer (BC) survivors who experience competing risks from cancer and its associated treatment. We examined whether physical or mental HRQoL (including individual subscales) or SD were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) of post-menopausal women free of prevalent CVD at baseline and diagnosed with invasive BC during study follow-up from 1993 - 2010. CVD was defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Scores (PCS and MCS, respectively), and SD, measured by the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale (IRS), were recorded post-BC diagnosis. Higher PCS and MCS scores indicate better HRQoL while higher IRS scores indicate worse SD. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring adjusted for relevant confounders most proximal to or at BC diagnosis.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher PCS scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table). For a 5-unit difference, the risk of CVD was 9% lower for those with higher PCS scores (95% CI: 0.83, 0.99). Of the SF-36 sub-scales, higher scores on vitality, physical functioning, and general health were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In BC survivors, we found that better physical HRQoL was associated with lower CVD risk. While further research is needed to replicate these findings, our results support existing recommendations that women with breast cancer adopt health behaviors that promote physical health.

Lack of Association Between Neurohormonal Blockade and Survival in Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Background Despite the belief that heart failure therapies are not effective in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, data are limited. We tested the association of neurohormonal blockade use with survival. Methods and Results A total of 309 consecutive patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis were identified. Medication inventory was obtained at baseline and subsequent visits. Exposure included a neurohormonal blockade class (β‐blocker [βB], angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and mineralocorticoid antagonist) at baseline and subsequent visits. βB was modeled as baseline use, time‐varying use, and in an inverse probability treatment weighted model. Primary outcome was all‐cause mortality analyzed with adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Continuing compared with stopping βB during follow‐up was tested. Mean age was 73.2 years, 84.1% were men, and 17.2% had atrial fibrillation/flutter at baseline. At the time of study entry, 49.8% were on βBs, 35.0% were on angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 23.9% were on mineralocorticoid antagonists. For the total cohort, there was a trend toward harm in the unadjusted model for baseline βB use, but this was neutral after adjustment. When βB use was analyzed as a time‐varying exposure, there was no association with mortality. βB discontinuation was associated with decreased mortality for the total cohort. Findings were consistent in inverse probability treatment weighted models. For angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or mineralocorticoid antagonist use, there was no association with mortality after adjustment for the total cohort. Conclusions There was no association of neurohormonal blockade use with survival in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. For the total cohort, deprescribing βB may be associated with improved survival. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings."

Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers, and Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for COVID‐19,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Background Use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB) is thought to affect COVID‐19 through modulating levels of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2, the cell entry receptor for SARS‐CoV2. We sought to assess the association between ACEi/ARB, biomarkers of inflammation, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID‐19. Methods and Results We leveraged the ISIC (International Study of Inflammation in COVID‐19), identified patients admitted for symptomatic COVID‐19 between February 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021 for COVID‐19, and examined the association between in‐hospital ACEi/ARB use and all‐cause death, need for ventilation, and need for dialysis. We estimated the causal effect of ACEi/ARB on the composite outcomes using marginal structural models accounting for serial blood pressure and serum creatinine measures. Of 2044 patients in ISIC, 1686 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 398 (23.6%) patients who were previously on ACEi/ARB received at least 1 dose during their hospitalization for COVID‐19. There were 215 deaths, 407 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and 124 patients who required dialysis during their hospitalization. Prior ACEi/ARB use was associated with lower levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and C‐reactive protein. In multivariable analysis, in‐hospital ACEi/ARB use was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome of in‐hospital death, mechanical ventilation, or dialysis (adjusted hazard ratio 0.49, 95% CI [0.36–0.65]). Conclusions In patients hospitalized for COVID‐19, ACEi/ARB use was associated with lower levels of inflammation and lower risk of in‐hospital outcomes. Clinical trials will define the role of ACEi/ARB in the treatment of COVID‐19. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04818866."

Paper Title
Risk of metabolic syndrome and metabolic phenotypes in relation to biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein intakes: an investigation from the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased mortality independent of BMI, resulting in discordant metabolic phenotypes, such as metabolically healthy obese and metabolically unhealthy normal-weight individuals. Studies investigating dietary intake in MetS have reported mixed results, due in part to the limitations of self-reported measures.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the role of biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein in MetS and metabolic phenotypes.


METHODS
Postmenopausal participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study who were free of MetS at baseline, had available data from FFQs at baseline, and had components of MetS at Year 3 (n = 3963) were included. Dietary energy and protein intakes were estimated using biomarker calibration methods. MetS was defined as 3 or more of the following: elevated serum triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<50 mg/dL), hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥130 or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg], elevated serum glucose (>100 mg/dL), and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference > 89 cm). Models were adjusted for age, WHI study component, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, recreational physical activity, disease history, and parity.


RESULTS
For every 10% increment in total calibrated energy intake, women were at a 1.37-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.15-1.63); a 10% increment in calibrated total protein intake was associated with a 1.21-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.00-1.47). Specifically, animal protein intake was associated with MetS (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14), whereas vegetable protein intake was not (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03). No differences were seen when examining metabolic phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that higher calibrated total energy, total protein, and total animal protein intakes were strongly associated with MetS. If replicated in clinical trials, these results will have implications for the promotion of energy and animal protein restrictions for the reduction of MetS risks."

Paper Title
Abstract 13885: Phenotyping Risk Profiles for Heart Failure With Preserved and Reduced Ejection Fraction Among Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Breast cancer (BC) survivors (BCS) are at increased risk for incident heart failure (HF). In this population, the risk for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has been understudied compared to HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). The purpose of this study was to estimate 1) the incidence of HFpEF and HFrEF, and 2) the phenotypic profiles conferring risk for incident HFpEF and HFrEF in BCS.
 
 
 Methods:
 This Women’s Health Initiative analysis was conducted in women with invasive BC stages I-IV in the Medical Records Cohort (MRC). Those with pre-existing HF were excluded. Exposures of interest were lifestyle factors [e.g. body mass index (BMI)], comorbidities [e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction (MI)], and BC treatment. Lifestyle factors and comorbidities most proximal and prior to BC diagnosis were assessed. In the MRC, BC and HF as well as left ventricular EF (LVEF) were ascertained through chart review and physician-adjudication. LVEF ≥50% was classified as HFpEF; and <50% for HFrEF per AHA/ACC guidelines. Cox proportional hazards models estimated risks of HFpEF and HFrEF. Follow up time began at BC diagnosis and HF events were recorded through March 1, 2019. All models adjusted for age at BC diagnosis.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,250 BCS, 153 developed HF after BC during a median follow-up of 7.3 years. Of those, 49 had HFrEF and 75 had HFpEF. The cumulative incidences of HFrEF and HFpEF over follow-up were 7.3% and 4.6%, respectively. Diabetes and MI were associated with both HFpEF and HFrEF (Table). Smoking, BMI ≥30, and hypertension were associated with HFpEF. Anthracycline use was associated with HFrEF but not HFpEF (p=0.03).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In BCS, lifestyle factors were associated with incident HFpEF, whereas anthracycline use was associated with a higher risk for HFrEF. Understanding risk factors associated with incident HFpEF and HFrEF in BCS is important to guide the implementation of risk profile-specific preventative measures and interventions.

Paper Title
Virtual adaptation of a nurse-driven strategy to improve blood pressure control among people with HIV.,

Year
2025,

Abstract
"People with HIV are at increased risk of cardiovascular events; thus, care delivery strategies that increase access to comprehensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk management are a priority. We report the results of a multi-component telemedicine-based strategy to improve blood pressure control among people with HIV-Assess and Adapt to the Impact of COVID-19 on CVD Self-Management and Prevention Care in Adults Living with HIV (AAIM-High). The AAIM High strategy is a virtual adaptation of our previously published EXTRA-CVD strategy and consisted of hypertension education and six components: nurse-led care coordination (delivered by teleconference or telephone), home systolic blood pressure (SBP) monitoring, evidence-based treatment algorithms, electronic health records tools, technology coach, and communication preferences assessment. People with HIV (n = 74) with comorbid hypertension at three academic medical centers were enrolled in a single arm implementation study from January 2021 to December 2022. Over 12 months, the average patient-performed home SBP decreased by 7.7 mmHg (95% CI -11.5, -3.9). The percentage of patients at treatment goal, defined as average SBP <130 mmHg, increased from 46.0% to 72.5% at 12 months. By adapting to the growing use of telemedicine in healthcare delivery, our study effectively improved hypertension control in people with HIV through a virtual, nurse-led intervention."

Paper Title
The influence of healthcare financing on cardiovascular disease prevention in people living with HIV,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"People living with HIV are diagnosed with age-related chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, at higher than expected rates. Medical management of these chronic health conditions frequently occur in HIV specialty clinics by providers trained in general internal medicine, family medicine, or infectious disease. In recent years, changes in the healthcare financing for people living with HIV in the U.S. has been dynamic due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. There is little evidence examining how healthcare financing characteristics shape primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention among people living with HIV. Our objective was to examine the perspectives of people living with HIV and their healthcare providers on how healthcare financing influences cardiovascular disease prevention. As part of the EXTRA-CVD study, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 51 people living with HIV and 34 multidisciplinary healthcare providers and at three U.S. HIV clinics in Ohio and North Carolina from October 2018 to March 2019. Thematic analysis using Template Analysis techniques was used to examine healthcare financing barriers and enablers of cardiovascular disease prevention in people living with HIV. Three themes emerged across sites and disciplines (1): healthcare payers substantially shape preventative cardiovascular care in HIV clinics (2); physician compensation tied to relative value units disincentivizes cardiovascular disease prevention efforts by HIV providers; and (3) grant-based services enable tailored cardiovascular disease prevention, but sustainability is limited by sponsor priorities. With HIV now a chronic disease, there is a growing need for HIV-specific cardiovascular disease prevention; however, healthcare financing complicates effective delivery of this preventative care. It is important to understand the effects of evolving payer models on patient and healthcare provider behavior. Additional systematic investigation of these models will help HIV specialty clinics implement cardiovascular disease prevention within a dynamic reimbursement landscape. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT03643705."

Paper Title
Associations of Health-Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance With Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Breast cancer (BC) survivors are at an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD), often attributed to cancer treatment. However, cancer treatment may also negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a risk factor of CVD in the general population. Objective We examined whether sleep disturbance, and physical or mental HRQoL were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative of postmenopausal women given a diagnosis of invasive BC during follow-up through 2010 with no history of CVD before BC. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke, after BC. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the Short-Form 36 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, and sleep disturbance, measured by the Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, were recorded post BC. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring and adjusted for relevant confounders. Results In 2884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher Physical Component Summary scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.99]; per 5-point increment in Physical Component Summary). No associations with CVD were found for Mental Component Summary or Insomnia Rating Scale. Conclusion In BC survivors, poor physical HRQoL is a significant predictor of CVD. Implications for Practice Our findings highlight the importance for nurses to assess and promote physical HRQoL as part of a holistic approach to mitigating the risk of CVD in BC survivors."

Feeling Younger, Rehabilitating Better: Reciprocal and Mediating Effects between Subjective Age and Functional Independence in Osteoporotic Fracture and Stroke Patients,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Introduction: The current study aimed to find reciprocal effects between subjective age and functional independence during rehabilitation from osteoporotic fractures and stroke and whether these effects can be mediated by indicators of well-being. Methods: Participants were 194 older adults (mean age = 78.32 years, SD = 7.37; 64.8% women) who were hospitalized following an osteoporotic fracture or stroke. Participants completed measures of subjective age and well-being (i.e., optimism, self-esteem, and life satisfaction) several times during rehabilitation. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was completed by nursing personnel at admission and at discharge. Results: Younger subjective age at admission predicted higher FIM scores at discharge. The reverse effect, that is, of FIM scores at admission on subjective age at discharge, was nonsignificant. Optimism during hospitalization mediated the effect of subjective age on subsequent FIM scores while self-esteem and life satisfaction did not. Sensitivity analyses further showed that the effect of subjective age on FIM was significant for both fracture and stroke patients. Discussion: The findings highlight the effect of subjective age on rehabilitation outcomes among osteoporotic fractures and stroke patients and suggest several potential mechanisms behind this effect. Rehabilitation outcomes following osteoporotic fractures or strokes could improve if subjective age and an optimistic outlook are taken into consideration."

Paper Title
Virtual Intervention for Caregivers of Persons With Lewy Body Dementia: Pilot Quasi-Experimental Single-Arm Study,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Compared to other types of dementia, family caregivers of people with Lewy body dementia (LBD) report higher stress levels and more severe depressive symptoms. Although several digital support interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia exist, few target LBD specifically or leverage a fully remote and asynchronous approach suitable for pandemic circumstances. Objective We performed a pilot evaluation of a digital intervention designed to help caregivers of people with LBD address challenges they have experienced, with the end goal of reducing psychological distress in this population. Methods We recruited 15 family caregivers of people with LBD to participate in the quasi-experimental, single-arm, mixed methods study titled Virtual Online Communities for Aging Life Experience–Lewy Body Dementia (VOCALE-LBD). The study offers an 8-week web-based intervention that uses a digital discussion platform and involves moderation, peer-to-peer support, didactic training, and problem-solving skill enactment. Results Participants’ baseline characteristics were the following: mean age 66 (SD 8) years; 14 of 15 (93%) of them were female; all (15/15, 100%) were White; and 8 (53%) of them had at least a postgraduate degree. Throughout the intervention, participants engaged in weekly web-based discussions, generating a total of 434 posts (average 4 posts per week). Attrition was 20% (3/15). Upon study exit, participants showed the following average improvements: 3.0 (SD 6.0) in depression, 8.3 (SD 16.7) in burden, 2.9 (SD 6.8) in stress, and 0.3 (SD 0.8) in loneliness. When looking at the proportion of participants with clinically signiﬁcant improvement versus those with a worsening of ≥0.5 SD for each outcome, we observed net improvements of 50% (6/12), 33% (4/12), 25% (3/12), and 25% (3/12) in depression, loneliness, burden, and stress, respectively. In terms of the benefits of participation, participants reported that participation helped them “a great deal” to (1) improve their understanding of LBD (9/12, 75%), (2) gain confidence in dealing with difficult behaviors of the care recipient (6/12, 50%), and (3) improve in one’s abilities to provide care to the care recipient (4/12, 33%). Conclusions The study generated promising feasibility and preliminary efficacy data for a low-cost, web-based intervention designed for caregivers of persons with LBD. Though the study was not powered for significance, we observed nominal average and net improvements in important psychological outcomes. Moreover, many caregivers reported that study participation helped them better understand the disease, feel more conﬁdent in dealing with difficult behaviors of the care recipient, and improve their ability to care for the care recipient. If validated in future studies, the intervention could be an accessible, on-demand resource for caregivers, enabling them to engage in moderated remote discussions with peers at their own convenience in terms of location, time of the day, and frequency.","

Paper Title
Association of sleep duration and insomnia with metabolic syndrome and its components in the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Epidemiological evidence suggests that inadequate sleep duration and insomnia may be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, longitudinal data with repeated measures of sleep duration and insomnia and of MetS are limited. We examined the association of sleep duration and insomnia with MetS and its components using longitudinal data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). Methods The study included postmenopausal women (ages 50–79 years) diabetes-free at enrollment in the WHI, with baseline data on sleep duration ( n  = 5,159), insomnia ( n  = 5,063), MetS, and its components. Repeated measures of self-reported sleep duration and insomnia were available from years 1 or 3 of follow-up and of the MetS components from years 3, 6 and 9. Associations were assessed using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations models, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for major risk factors were calculated . Results In cross-sectional analysis, baseline sleep duration ≥ 9 h was positively associated with MetS (OR = 1.51; 95%CI 1.12–2.04), while sleep duration of 8- < 9 h was associated with waist circumference > 88 cm and triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL (OR = 1.18; 95%CI 1.01–1.40 and OR = 1.23; 95%CI 1.05–1.46, respectively). Insomnia had a borderline positive association with MetS (OR = 1.14; 95%CI 0.99–1.31), and significant positive associations with waist circumference > 88 cm and glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL (OR = 1.18; 95%CI 1.03–1.34 and OR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.02–1.35, respectively). In the longitudinal analysis, change from restful sleep to insomnia over time was associated with increased odds of developing MetS (OR = 1.40; 95%CI 1.01–1.94), and of a triglyceride level ≥ 150 mg/dL (OR = 1.48; 95%CI 1.08–2.03). Conclusions Among postmenopausal women in the WHI, sleep duration and insomnia were associated with current and future risk of MetS and some of its components."

Paper Title
Behavioral Change Factors and Retention in Web-Based Interventions for Informal Caregivers of People Living With Dementia: Scoping Review,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Background Web-based interventions aimed at supporting informal caregivers of people living with dementia have the potential to improve caregivers’ well-being and psychological health. However, few interventions are widely implemented for this population, and none of the prior reviews have systematically examined the use of behavior change techniques (BCTs), theories, and agents in web-based interventions for informal caregivers of people living with dementia. To better understand this implementation gap, we reviewed the literature to map behavioral factors (BCTs, theories, and agents) deployed in the studies. Furthermore, because there is an emerging consensus that retention could be shaped by participant characteristics and behavioral factors, we explored relationships between these features and retention rates across studies. Objective We pursued 3 objectives: to map behavioral factors involved in the web-based interventions for informal caregivers of people living with dementia; to examine the relationship between behavioral change elements and retention in the studies; and to examine the relationship between participant characteristics (gender, age, and spouse or adult children caregiver proportion) and study retention. Methods We conducted a literature review using the following keywords and their corresponding Medical Subject Headings terms: dementia, caregivers, and web-based intervention. The time limits were January 1998 to March 2022. Using the BCTv1 taxonomy, which specifies active behavioral components in interventions, 2 coders collected, summarized, and analyzed the frequency distributions of BCTs. Similarly, they abstracted and analyzed participant characteristics, behavior change theories, behavior change agents, and retention rates in the studies. Results The average age was 61.5 (SD 7.4) years, and the average proportion of spousal informal caregivers, adult children informal caregivers, and retention rates were 51.2% (SD 24.8%), 44.8% (SD 22%), and 70.4% (SD 17%), respectively. Only 53% (17/32) of the studies used behavior change theories, but 81% (26/32) included behavior change agents. The most common BCTv1 clusters were shaping knowledge and social support. The median number of BCTv1 clusters was 5 (IQR 3). We observed a negative correlation between the proportion of spousal informal caregivers and the retention rate (r=−0.45; P=.02) and between the number of BCTv1 clusters and retention rates (r=−0.47; P=.01). We also found that the proportion of adult children informal caregivers in the study was significantly and positively correlated with the retention rate (r=0.5; P=.03). No other participant characteristics or behavioral factors were associated with retention rates. Conclusions We found that almost half of the studies were not informed by behavior change theories. In addition, spousal involvement and a higher number of BCTs were each associated with lower retention rates, while the involvement of adult children caregivers in the study was associated with higher retention. In planning future studies, researchers should consider matching participant characteristics with their intended intervention as the alignment might improve their retention rates.","

Pilot Evaluation of a Virtual Intervention for Caregivers of Persons with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) (Preprint),

Year
2022,

Abstract
"
BACKGROUND
Compared to other types of dementia, family caregivers of people with LBD report higher stress and more severe depressive symptoms.


OBJECTIVE
We performed a pilot evaluation of a digital intervention designed to help caregivers address challenges that they have experienced, with the end goal of reducing psychological distress in this population.


METHODS
We recruited 15 family caregivers to participate in the quasi-experimental single-arm mixed methods study entitled VOCALE-LBD. The study offers an 8-week online intervention that uses a web-based discussion platform and involves moderation, peer-to-peer support, didactic training, and problem-solving skill enactment.


RESULTS
Participants’ baseline characteristics were as follows: Mean age (SD)= 66(8); 93% female; 100% White; and 53% had at least a post-graduate degree. Throughout the intervention, participants engaged in weekly online discussions, generating a total of 434 posts (average 4 posts/week). Attrition was 20%. At the study exit, participants showed improvements in depression, burden, stress, and loneliness. When we calculated differences in the proportion of participants with clinically signiﬁcant improvement versus worsening of 0.5 SD or more for each outcome, we observed net improvements of 50%, 33%, 25%, and 25% in depression, loneliness, burden, and stress, respectively. When we assessed the benefits of participation, 75% of the participants reported that participation helped them to improve their understanding of LBD ‘a great deal,’ vs. 25% selecting the ‘some’ response option. Similarly, in response to a question about confidence in dealing with difficult behaviors of the care recipient, 50% of the participants selected ‘a great deal’, 42% ‘some’, and 8% ‘not at all’ response options. Finally, in response to a question about improvement in one’s abilities to provide care to the care recipient, 33% of the participants selected ‘a great deal’, 58% ‘some’, and 8% ‘not at all’ response options.


CONCLUSIONS
The study generated promising feasibility and efficacy data for a low-cost, online intervention designed for caregivers of persons with LBD. As the study was not powered for significance, we observed nominal average and net improvements in important psychological outcomes. Moreover, many caregivers reported that study participation helped them better understand the disease, feel more conﬁdent in dealing with difficult behavior of the care recipient, and improved their ability to care for the care recipient. If validated in future studies, the intervention could be an accessible, on-demand resource for caregivers to engage in moderated remote discussions with peers at their own convenience in terms of location, time of day and frequency. As far as pragmatic considerations, the intervention could be used in conjunction with caregiver usual care and as a stand-alone module in circumstances, such as current and future pandemic emergencies, when professional interventions in general and subspecialty care in particular might not be readily available.

Paper Title
Behavior change factors and retention in dietary interventions for older adults: scoping review.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Although poor diet is a major driver of morbidity and mortality in people 60 and older, few dietary interventions are widely implemented for this population. We mapped behavior change theories, agents, and techniques in dietary interventions for adults 60+ and explored relationships between these factors and ability to retain at least 80% of the study participants.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We conducted a scoping review using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science through April 2021 for dietary interventions in adults 60 and older. We collated, summarized, and calculated frequency distributions of behavior change theories, behavior change agents, and behavior change techniques (BCTs) using BCTv1 taxonomy with regard to participant retention across 43 studies.


RESULTS
Only 49% and 30% of the studies reported behavior theory and change agents respectively. Of the studies reporting on theory and agents, the most common were social cognitive theory and the related mechanism of self-efficacy. The most common BCTv1 were "shaping knowledge" and "goals and planning." Several BCTv1 such as "antecedents" and "reward and threat" and evidence for concordance between BCTs and change agents were more common in interventions with higher retention rates.


DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Mechanistically concordant studies with BCTs that involve resource allocation and positive reinforcement through rewards may be advantageous for retention in dietary intervention for older adults. Future studies should continue developing theory and mechanism-oriented research. Furthermore, future studies should consider diversifying the portfolio of currently deployed BCTs and strengthening a concordance between BCTs and mechanisms of change."

Associations of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and cardiac damage biomarkers and radiation-induced fatigue in breast cancer survivors.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"191 Background: Radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) is common in breast cancer (BC) survivors and can last years after treatment. Despite the known physiological consequences of radiation, information on biomarkers of RIF is limited. Therefore, we examined the longitudinal association between serum biomarkers and post-BC fatigue in BC survivors treated with radiation: [oxidative stress] 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), myeloperoxidase (MPO); [inflammation] interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), placental growth factor (PGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B); [cardiac damage] cystatin-C, troponin-I (TnI). Methods: In an ancillary study in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), participants with incident BC (stages I-III) treated with radiation were followed for the development of fatigue post-BC. Women were eligible if they 1) had no prior cardiovascular disease and 2) had pre-and post-BC serum samples drawn approximately three years apart with fatigue measured using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) vitality subscale at the same times. Biomarkers were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Higher SF-36 vitality scores correspond to lesser fatigue. Weighted linear regression adjusted for relevant demographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors, as well as pre-cancer fatigue. Each biomarker was modeled as the post-BC to pre-BC ratio and log transformed to base 2, thus, the effect estimates correspond to a doubling in value compared to pre-BC. Results: A total of 180 women with a mean (SD) age of 67.0 (5.5) were included. The mean (SD) vitality score was 66.2 (17.2) and 59.7 (19.7) pre- and post-BC, respectively. The median (IQR) time between pre-BC serum collection to BC was 1.9 (0.8, 2.6) years and 1.4 (0.7, 2.3) years between BC and the post-BC serum collection. After adjustment, a higher biomarker ratio of cystatin-C, IL-6, and GDF-15 were all associated with a lower SF-36 vitality score (i.e., higher fatigue) (Table). As an example, for a 2-fold difference in the cystatin-C biomarker ratio, the SF-36 vitality score was lower by 7.31 points (95% CI: -14.2, -0.45). Conclusions: Inflammatory and cardiac damage biomarkers are associated with RIF in BC survivors. Biomarkers could be measured in clinical practice or be included in risk prediction models to help identify patients at high risk for RIF. [Table: see text]"

Paper Title
Incident Dementia, Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Levels and Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations in People Age 65 and Older with Diabetes.,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
To determine whether incident dementia and HbA1c levels are associated with increased rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPH) in persons with diabetes.


METHODS
565 adults age 65+ ever treated for diabetes were from ACT study. PPH were from principal discharge diagnoses and included diabetes PPH (dPPH), respiratory PPH (rPPH), urinovolemic PPH (uPPH), cardiovascular, and other PPH. Poisson generalized estimating equations estimated rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between dementia or HbA1c measures and rate of PPH.


RESULTS
562 individuals contributed 3602 dementia-free years, and 132 individuals contributed 511 dementia follow-up years. 128 (23%) dementia-free individuals had 210 PPH admissions and a crude rate of 58 per 1000 person-years while 55 (42%) individuals with dementia had 93 PPH admissions, a rate of 182 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted RR (95% CI) comparing rates between dementia and dementia-free groups were 2.27 (1.60, 3.21) for overall PPH; 5.90 (2.70, 12.88) for dPPH; 5.17 (2.49, 10.73) for uPPH, and 2.01 (1.06, 3.83) for rPPH. Compared with HbA1c of 7-8% and adjusted for dementia, the RR (95% CI) for overall PPH was 1.43 (1.00, 2.06) for >8% and 1.18 (0.85, 1.65) for <7% HbA1c. The uPPH RR was also increased, comparing >8% and <7% HbA1c levels.


CONCLUSION
Incident dementia is associated with higher rates of PPH among people with diabetes, especially PPHs due to diabetes, UTI, and dehydration. Potential evidence suggested that HbA1c levels of >8% vs. lower levels are associated with higher rates of overall, UTI and dehydration-related PPHs.","

Frailty measurements in hospitalised orthopaedic populations age 65 and older: A scoping review,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Abstract Aims and Objectives To identify and compare frailty instruments used with hospitalised orthopaedic patients aged over 65. Background Frailty predicts clinical events in orthopaedic patients aged over 65. However, the strengths and limitations of different approaches to measuring frailty in this population are rarely discussed. As such, a comprehensive review to address the gap is needed. Design Scoping review using Arksey and O’Malley framework. Methods PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies published from 2006 to 2020 regarding frailty instruments in older orthopaedic patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses were followed. Results The initial search resulted in 1,471 articles. After review against inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final set of 31 articles containing 15 unique frailty instruments were evaluated. Most of the articles were from Western countries. Fried's phenotype and Frailty Index were commonly used. The frailty index was mostly modified to measure frailty. In hip fracture, physical function items were frequently modified in the measurement of frailty. Trained physicians and nurses administered most frailty instruments. Frailty screening was commonly conducted at hospital admission and used to prognosticate both postoperative complications and hospital outcomes. Most instruments could be completed within 10 min. Reported psychometrics had acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusion Many reliable frailty measures have been used in the inpatient orthopaedic settings; however, evidence is still lacking for a gold standard frailty instrument. More research is needed to identify the best‐performing measure. Frailty evaluation in patients with physical limitations is challenging with existing instruments. Clinical context, resources required and instrument quality are essential factors in selecting a frailty instrument. Relevance to clinical practice Musculoskeletal symptoms in older patients may bias frailty assessment. Proactive frailty screening with valid and practical instruments is vital to strengthen preoperative risk stratification and improve post‐surgical outcomes."

Abstract 11147: Associations of Physical and Mental-Health Related Quality of Life and Sleep Disturbance with Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Post-Menopausal Breast Cancer Survivors,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and greater sleep disturbance (SD) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. However, these associations may differ in breast cancer (BC) survivors who experience competing risks from cancer and its associated treatment. We examined whether physical or mental HRQoL (including individual subscales) or SD were associated with CVD risk in BC survivors.
 
 
 Methods:
 We conducted a longitudinal analysis in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) of post-menopausal women free of prevalent CVD at baseline and diagnosed with invasive BC during study follow-up from 1993 - 2010. CVD was defined as physician-adjudicated coronary heart disease or stroke. Physical and mental HRQoL, measured by the SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Scores (PCS and MCS, respectively), and SD, measured by the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale (IRS), were recorded post-BC diagnosis. Higher PCS and MCS scores indicate better HRQoL while higher IRS scores indicate worse SD. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models were used starting at BC diagnosis until 2010 or censoring adjusted for relevant confounders most proximal to or at BC diagnosis.
 
 
 Results:
 In 2,884 BC survivors, 157 developed CVD during a median follow-up of 9.5 years. After adjustment, higher PCS scores were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table). For a 5-unit difference, the risk of CVD was 9% lower for those with higher PCS scores (95% CI: 0.83, 0.99). Of the SF-36 sub-scales, higher scores on vitality, physical functioning, and general health were significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (Table).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 In BC survivors, we found that better physical HRQoL was associated with lower CVD risk. While further research is needed to replicate these findings, our results support existing recommendations that women with breast cancer adopt health behaviors that promote physical health.

Paper Title
Promoting Problem Solving About Health Management: A Mixed-Methods Pilot Evaluation of a Digital Health Intervention for Older Adults With Pre-Frailty and Frailty,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Background: There is a need for interventions to promote health management of older adults with pre-frailty and frailty. Technology poses promising solutions, but questions exist about effective delivery. Objectives: We present the results of a mixed-methods pilot evaluation of Virtual Online Communities for Older Adults (VOCALE), an 8-week intervention conducted in the northwestern United States, in which participants shared health-related experiences and applied problem solving skills in a Facebook group. Methods: We performed a mixed-methods process evaluation, integrating quantitative and qualitative data, to characterize the intervention and its effects. We focus on four areas: health-related measures (health literacy and self-efficacy), participation, problem solving skills enacted, and subjective feedback. Results: Eight older adults with pre-frailty and frailty (age = 82.7 ± 6.6 years) completed the study. There was an upward trend in health literacy and health self-efficacy post-intervention. Participants posted at least two times per week. Content analysis of 210 posts showed participants were able to apply the problem solving skills taught, and exit interviews showed participants’ increased awareness of the need to manage health, and enjoyment in learning about others. Conclusion: This mixed-methods evaluation provides insight into feasibility and design considerations for online interventions to promote health management among vulnerable older adults."

Paper Title
Risk of metabolic syndrome and metabolic phenotypes in relation to biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein intakes: an investigation from the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased mortality independent of BMI, resulting in discordant metabolic phenotypes, such as metabolically healthy obese and metabolically unhealthy normal-weight individuals. Studies investigating dietary intake in MetS have reported mixed results, due in part to the limitations of self-reported measures.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the role of biomarker-calibrated estimates of energy and protein in MetS and metabolic phenotypes.


METHODS
Postmenopausal participants from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study who were free of MetS at baseline, had available data from FFQs at baseline, and had components of MetS at Year 3 (n = 3963) were included. Dietary energy and protein intakes were estimated using biomarker calibration methods. MetS was defined as 3 or more of the following: elevated serum triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<50 mg/dL), hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥130 or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg], elevated serum glucose (>100 mg/dL), and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference > 89 cm). Models were adjusted for age, WHI study component, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, recreational physical activity, disease history, and parity.


RESULTS
For every 10% increment in total calibrated energy intake, women were at a 1.37-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.15-1.63); a 10% increment in calibrated total protein intake was associated with a 1.21-fold elevated risk of MetS (95% CI, 1.00-1.47). Specifically, animal protein intake was associated with MetS (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14), whereas vegetable protein intake was not (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03). No differences were seen when examining metabolic phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that higher calibrated total energy, total protein, and total animal protein intakes were strongly associated with MetS. If replicated in clinical trials, these results will have implications for the promotion of energy and animal protein restrictions for the reduction of MetS risks."

Paper Title
Short Sleep Is Associated With Low Bone Mineral Density and Osteoporosis in the Women's Health Initiative,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"Short sleep duration, recognized as a public health epidemic, is associated with adverse health conditions, yet little is known about the association between sleep and bone health. We tested the associations of usual sleep behavior and bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. In a sample of 11,084 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI; mean age 63.3 years, SD = 7.4), we performed a cross‐sectional study of the association of self‐reported usual hours of sleep and sleep quality (WHI Insomnia Rating Score) with whole body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine BMD using linear regression models. We also studied the association of sleep duration and quality with dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA)‐defined low bone mass (T‐score < −2.5 to <−1) and osteoporosis (T‐score ≤ −2.5) using multinomial regression models. We adjusted for age, DXA machine, race, menopausal symptoms, education, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical function, and sleep medication use. In adjusted linear regression models, women who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per night had on average 0.012 to 0.018 g/cm2 significantly lower BMD at all four sites compared with women who reported sleeping 7 hours per night (reference). In adjusted multinomial models, women reporting 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of low bone mass and osteoporosis of the hip (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–1.45, and 1.63; 1.15–2.31, respectively). We observed a similar pattern for spine BMD, where women with 5 hours or less per night had higher odds of osteoporosis (adjusted OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.02–1.60). Associations of sleep quality and DXA BMD failed to reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration was associated with lower BMD and higher risk of osteoporosis. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm the cross‐sectional effects of sleep duration on bone health and explore associated mechanisms. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."

Paper Title
Association between having a family member with dementia and perceptions of dementia preventability,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"Abstract Background One’s experience with dementia may affect their perceptions about dementia preventability, which in turn could influence preventive health behaviors. We aimed to examine how having a family history of dementia and caregiving experience are associated with perceptions about and self-efficacy for dementia preventability. Methods Cross-sectional, self-administered survey. Participants reported whether they have had a family member with dementia and, among those who reported having a family member with dementia, whether they served as a caregiver. Outcomes were perceptions about the likelihood of dementia preventability, self-efficacy for dementia prevention, and benefits of specific dementia prevention strategies. Associations were assessed via partial proportional odds model for ordinal outcome variables and logistic regression for binary outcome variables. Results Of 1,575 respondents, 71% had a family member with dementia, of which 42% served as a caregiver. People with a family member with dementia were less likely to believe that dementia is preventable (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.96) and had lower self-efficacy for dementia prevention (aOR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.90). The subgroup analysis among those with caregiving experience was consistent with the primary findings, showing less belief in the likelihood of dementia preventability (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.03) and self-efficacy (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.00). Conclusion Having a family member with dementia is associated with unfavorable perceptions about dementia preventability. Incorporating family history of dementia into communication efforts about dementia risk reduction may help address potential barriers to preventive health behaviors.","

Paper Title
High glycemic index and glycemic load diets as risk factors for insomnia: analyses from the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have shown mixed results on the association between carbohydrate intake and insomnia. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates have on risk of insomnia is likely commensurate with their relative contribution to the overall diet, so studies are needed that measure overall dietary glycemic index (GI), glycemic load, and intakes of specific types of carbohydrates.


OBJECTIVE
We hypothesized that higher GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of insomnia prevalence and incidence.


METHODS
This was a prospective cohort study with postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, investigating the relations of GI, glycemic load, other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, starch, total carbohydrate), dietary fiber, and specific carbohydrate-containing foods (whole grains, nonwhole/refined grains, nonjuice fruits, vegetables, dairy products) with odds of insomnia at baseline (between 1994 and 1998; n = 77,860) and after 3 y of follow-up (between 1997 and 2001; n = 53,069).


RESULTS
In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, higher dietary GI was associated with increasing odds of prevalent (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.11; CI: 1.05, 1.16; P-trend = 0.0014) and incident (fifth compared with first quintile OR: 1.16; CI: 1.08, 1.25; P-trend < 0.0001) insomnia in fully adjusted models. Higher intakes of dietary added sugars, starch, and nonwhole/refined grains were each associated with higher odds of incident insomnia. By contrast, higher nonjuice fruit and vegetable intakes were significantly associated with lower odds of incident insomnia. Also, higher intakes of dietary fiber, whole grains, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables were significantly associated with lower odds of prevalent insomnia.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for insomnia in postmenopausal women. Substitution of high-GI foods with minimally processed, whole, fiber-rich carbohydrates should be evaluated as potential treatments of, and primary preventive measures for, insomnia in postmenopausal women."

Paper Title
Diet Quality and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Postmenopausal Women With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Women's Health Initiative,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Background Dietary patterns are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the general population, but diet–CVD association in populations with diabetes mellitus is limited. Our objective was to examine the association between diet quality and CVD risk in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods and Results We analyzed prospective data from 5809 women with prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline from the Women's Health Initiative. Diet quality was defined using alternate Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension, Paleolithic, and American Diabetes Association dietary pattern scores calculated from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazard regression was used to analyze the risk of incident CVD. During mean 12.4 years of follow‐up, 1454 (25%) incident CVD cases were documented. Women with higher alternate Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension, and American Diabetes Association dietary pattern scores had a lower risk of CVD compared with women with lower scores (Q5 v Q1) (hazard ratio [HR]aMed 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.93; HRDASH 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.83; HRADA 0.71, 95% CI 0.59–0.86). No association was observed between the Paleolithic score and CVD risk. Conclusions Dietary patterns that emphasize higher intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts/seeds, legumes, a high unsaturated:saturated fat ratio, and lower intake of red and processed meats, added sugars, and sodium are associated with lower CVD risk in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Paper Title
Self-Supporting Card Plot in «The Queen of Spades»,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"The success of a card secret arises not only due to the knowledge of the cards themselves but also due to an implied treaty between a bearer and receiver of a gift. We reconstruct the conditions of this treaty T1 that describe the transmission of this secret from Saint-Germain to the countess and from her to Chaplitsky. As a result, a receiver of such a gift becomes its potential bearer. Further, not only the knowledge of concrete cards and the conditions of the treaty are transmitted along the chain but also the ability itself to such a transmission (the property of hereditability).

Only one conditions of treaty T1 is explicated in the text – this is the prohibition of further gambling. The other conditions are recovered according to the logic of the plot. In doing so, we find a so-called «hidden plot» that ensables us to explain the Chaplitsky’s story and relate it to the motif of receiving a heritage. At the same time, this finding explains why the countess opened her mystery just to Chaplitsky (but not to other young people). This is because both of them found themselves in the situation when a rich relative had a possibility to cover a card debt but denied to do it. The presence of the mechanism in which the card secret is transmitted from one generation to another, makes a card plot self-supporting.

When the countess’s ghost opens the secret to Germann, the initial conditions change, so instead of treaty T1 that was in force in the previous cases, now a new treat T2 becomes relevant. We analyze the difference between T1 and T2 and how the violation of T2 leads Germann to the failure. Marriage between Germann and Lizaveta Ivanovna, necessity of which was claimed by the ghost, is important not only for the countess’s ghost itself but also for fantastic forces that sent the ghost to Germann. In case of the marriage, Germann could transmit the card secret to his children and thus continue the card plot.

We also suggest an interpretation of a new condition in T2 which was absent from T1 – to stake no more than 1 card per day. This gave possibility for Germann to fulfill the condition about marriage before the end of game. As he ignored this condition (not given explicitly but tacitly assumed), fantastic forces, correspondingly, also ignore theirs. They intruded in the game giving rise to his failure. Replacing the image of a young queen with that of an old woman corresponds to previous actions of Germann himself who preferred to seek for a card secret instead of love of the countess's pupil and did not change this state of affairs.

Our reasonings generalize essentially a recent key observation made by V . S. Listov about the motif of inheritance in this Pushkin work."

Use of a Wearable Technology and Motivational Interviews to Improve Sleep in Older Adults With Osteoarthritis and Sleep Disturbance: A Pilot Study.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"The feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mobile health self-management intervention aimed at improving sleep among older adults with osteoarthritis and disturbed sleep were evaluated. This was a one-group pre-/posttest pilot study. Feasibility was measured by the number of participants eligible, enrolled, and retained. Primary efficacy outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and two sleep actigraphy variables: total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE). Overall step count, self-efficacy (SEff), and acceptance of sleep difficulties (ASD) were mechanisms of action variables. Assessments were at baseline, Week 14 (postintervention), and Week 19 (follow up). Mixed effect models were used to measure change over time. Twenty-four participants (mean age = 71 years) were enrolled and 22 completed the study. Improvements of 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] [-2.43, -0.05]; p = 0.04) and 2.5 (95% CI [0.9, 4.9]; p = 0.02) points in the ISI and ASD scores, respectively, were found over the 19-week period. These findings add to a growing literature that suggests older adults might reap benefits from mobile health interventions.

Using an Innovative Discussion Platform to Give Voice to Aging-Related Experiences: A Pilot Study.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Exchanging information with peers may support older adults' management of aging-related health changes, including frailty. The current pilot study used a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate an online virtual community for older adults to discuss aging-related health issues and management strategies. Eight older adults (mean age = 84) were enrolled at the start of the study. During a 10-week moderated discussion, participants contributed a total of 133 responses. Common themes included (a) symptoms (e.g., pain, weakness/tiredness, sleep difficulties) and (b) management strategies (e.g., health behavior changes, psychosocial support). A positive trend of change was noted in participants' average self-reported health and chronic disease management self-efficacy scores. This platform could facilitate information exchange among older adults, empowering them to leverage their own knowledge to improve their health management strategies. Future research should expand on this study to include older adults of diverse racial, educational, and cultural backgrounds. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 45(12), 33-40.]."

Psychological Traits, Heart Rate Variability, and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease in Healthy Aging Women—The Women's Health Initiative,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Objective Psychological traits such as optimism and hostility affect coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but mechanisms for this association are unclear. We hypothesized that optimism and hostility may affect CHD risk via changes in heart rate variability (HRV). Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the Women's Health Initiative Myocardial Ischemia and Migraine Study. Participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring 3 years after enrollment. Optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), cynical hostility (Cook-Medley), demographics, and coronary risk factors were assessed at baseline. HRV measures included standard deviation of average N-N intervals (SDNN); standard deviation of average N-N intervals for 5 minutes (SDANN); and average heart rate (HR). CHD was defined as the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, angina, coronary angioplasty, and bypass grafting. Linear and Cox regression models adjusted for CHD risk factors were used to examine, respectively, associations between optimism, hostility, and HRV and between HRV and CHD risk. Results Final analyses included 2655 women. Although optimism was not associated with HRV, hostility was inversely associated with HRV 3 years later (SDANN: adjusted &bgr; = −0.54; 95% CI = −0.97 to −0.11; SDNN: −0.49; 95% CI = −0.93 to −0.05). HRV was inversely associated with CHD risk; for each 10-millisecond increase in SDNN or SDANN, there was a decrease in CHD risk of 9% (p = .023) and 12% (p = .006), respectively. Conclusions HRV did not play a major role in explaining why more optimistic women seem to be somewhat protected from CHD risk. Although hostility was inversely associated with HRV, its role in explaining the association between hostility and CHD risk remains to be established."

Associations between ACE-Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Lean Body Mass in Community Dwelling Older Women,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"Studies suggest that ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may preserve skeletal muscle with aging. We evaluated longitudinal differences in lean body mass (LBM) among women diagnosed with hypertension and classified as ACE-I/ARB users and nonusers among Women's Health Initiative participants that received dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to estimate body composition (n=10,635) at baseline and at years 3 and 6 of follow-up. Of those, 2642 were treated for hypertension at baseline. Multivariate linear regression models, adjusted for relevant demographics, behaviors, and medications, assessed ACE-I/ARB use/nonuse and LBM associations at baseline, as well as change in LBM over 3 and 6 years. Although BMI did not differ by ACE-I/ARB use, LBM (%) was significantly higher in ACE-I/ARB users versus nonusers at baseline (52.2% versus 51.3%, resp., p=0.001). There was no association between ACE-I/ARB usage and change in LBM over time. Reasons for higher LBM with ACE-I/ARB use cross sectionally, but not longitundinally, are unclear and may reflect a threshold effect of these medications on LBM that is attenuated over time. Nevertheless, ACE-I/ARB use does not appear to negatively impact LBM in the long term."

Perception Counts: The Relationships of Inner Perceptions of Trauma and PTSD Symptoms Across Time,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"Objective: This study examined how inner perceptions that develop in the aftermath of exposure to trauma attenuate the association between posttraumatic symptoms across time and what the reciprocal relations between inner perceptions of trauma and posttraumatic symptoms are. Method: The present article is based on two studies. The data in Study 1 are drawn from three waves of a longitudinal study of community-dwelling midlife adults and older adults residing in the south of Israel. In Wave 1, 339 participants were interviewed (mean age = 65.44, SD = 9.77). Of these participants, 170 and 132, respectively, participated in Waves 2 (one year later) and 3 (two years later). Posttraumatic stress symptoms were self-reported in all three waves. Inner perceptions of trauma were assessed with the Subjective Traumatic Outlook scale (STO) and Centrality of Event Scale (CES), administered at Wave 3. Study 2 is drawn from two waves of research of young adults. Wave 1 included 138 participants (mean age = 32.01, SD = 10.57) from a convenience sample. At Wave 2, 128 participants were interviewed again a month later. Participants reported their level of posttraumatic stress symptoms and completed the STO and the CES in both waves. Results: In Study 1, analyses showed stronger associations between posttraumatic symptoms across waves among those who reported higher subjective traumatic outlook and higher centrality of events. In Study 2, significant reciprocal relationships between PTSD and STO were found, but whereas the W1 PTSD–W2 CES path was significant, the W1 CES–W2 PTSD path was not. Conclusions: The findings emphasize that overintegration and especially disintegration of the pretraumatic identity with traumatic experiences are associated with the deleterious effects of long-lasting exposure to traumatic events."

Anthropometric measures and serum estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women: the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Several anthropometric measures have been associated with hormone-related cancers. However, it is unknown whether estrogen metabolism plays an important role in these relationships. We examined whether measured current body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), height, and self-reported BMI at age 18 years were associated with serum estrogens/estrogen metabolites using baseline, cross-sectional data from 1835 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. Fifteen estrogens/estrogen metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Geometric means (GMs) of estrogens/estrogen metabolites (in picomoles per liter) were estimated using inverse probability weighted linear regression, adjusting for potential confounders and stratified on menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use. Among never or former MHT users, current BMI (≥30 vs. <25 kg/m2) was positively associated with parent estrogens (multivariable adjusted GM 432 vs. 239 pmol/L for estrone, 74 vs. 46 pmol/L for estradiol; p-trend < 0.001 for both) and all of the 2-, 4-, and 16-pathway estrogen metabolites evaluated (all p-trend ≤ 0.02). After additional adjustment for estradiol, unconjugated methylated 2-catechols were inversely associated (e.g., 2-methoxyestrone multivariable GM 9.3 vs. 12.0 pmol/L; p-trend < 0.001). Among current MHT users, current BMI was not associated with parent estrogens but was inversely associated with methylated catechols (e.g., 2-methoxyestrone multivariable GM 216 vs. 280 pmol/L; p-trend = 0.008). Similar patterns of association were found with WHR; however, the associations were not independent of BMI. Height and BMI at age 18 years were not associated with postmenopausal estrogens/estrogen metabolite levels. Our data suggest that postmenopausal BMI is associated with increased circulating levels of parent estrogens and reduced methylation of catechol estrogen metabolites, the estrogen metabolism patterns that have previously been associated with higher breast cancer risk."

Trajectories of physical function prior to death and brain neuropathology in a community-based cohort: the act study,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"BackgroundMechanisms linking cognitive and physical functioning in older adults are unclear. We sought to determine whether brain pathological changes relate to the level or rate of physical performance decline.MethodsThis study analyzed data from 305 participants in the autopsy subcohort of the prospective Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. Participants were aged 65+ and free of dementia at enrollment. Physical performance was measured at baseline and every two years using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Data from 3174 ACT participants with ≥2 SPPB measurements were used to estimate two physical function measures: 1) rate of SPPB decline defined by intercept and slope; and 2) estimated SPPB 5 years prior to death. Neuropathology findings at autopsy included neurofibrillary tangles (Braak stage), neuritic plaques (CERAD level), presence of amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, cystic infarcts, and Lewy bodies. Associations (adjusted for sex, age, body mass index and education) between dichotomized neuropathologic outcomes and SPPB measures were estimated using modified Poisson regression with inverse probability weights (IPW) estimated via Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Relative risks for the 20th, 40th, and 60th percentiles (lowest levels and highest rates of decline) relative to the 80th percentile (highest level and lowest rate of decline) were calculated.ResultsDecedents with the least vs. most SPPB decline (slope > 75th vs. < 25th percentiles) had higher SPPB scores, and were more likely to be male, older, have higher education, and exercise regularly at baseline. No significant associations were observed between neuropathology findings and rate of SPPB decline. Lower predicted SPPB scores 5 years prior to death were associated with higher risk of microinfarcts (RR = 3.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.07 for the 20th vs. 80th percentiles of SPPB) and significantly higher risk of cystic infarcts (RR = 2.72, 95% CI 1.45–5.57 for 20th vs. 80th percentiles of SPPB).ConclusionCystic infarcts and microinfarcts, but not neuropathology findings of Alzheimer’s disease, were related to physical performance levels five years before death. No pathology findings were associated with rates of physical performance decline. Physical function levels in the years prior to death may be affected by vascular brain pathologies."

Abstract 14: Diet Quality and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Postmenopausal Women With Type 2 Diabetes: the Women’s Health Initiative,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are known to be influenced by dietary intake, however there is little evidence from large and well characterized cohort studies regarding the relationship between popular dietary patterns and CVD risk in populations with T2D. Understanding how common diet scores associate with CVD risk may provide better nutrition recommendations, education, and targeted interventions in the population with T2D.
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 We hypothesize that high diet quality as represented by higher scores on four different a priori diet indices is associated with a lower risk of developing CVD in postmenopausal women with T2D.
 
 
 Methods:
 We analyzed data of 6031 postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort with no history of CVD at baseline. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated WHI food frequency questionnaire. Diet scores for four different diet patterns were calculated: Mediterranean (aMed), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Paleolithic diet, and American Diabetes Association dietary recommendations (ADA). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke during study follow up for each dietary pattern score, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle and clinical measures.
 
 
 Results:
 Over 21 years of follow up 11.2% (675/6031) of women developed CHD and 6.7% (408/6031) had a stroke. There was a strong, monotonic inverse association between higher aMed, DASH, and ADA diet scores and risk of incident CHD and stroke; and no association between the Paleolithic dietary pattern score and CHD or stroke (Table 1).
 
 
 Conclusions:
 There are multiple dietary avenues to lower CVD risk in a population with T2D via the aMed, DASH, and ADA diets; whereas there was no evidence the Paleolithic diet score is associated with CVD risk in a population with T2D.

Paper Title
A Low-Fat Dietary Pattern and Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis From the Women’s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE We performed a secondary analysis to evaluate the effect of the Women’s Health Initiative dietary intervention on incident diabetes and diabetes treatment in postmenopausal women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 48,835 women were randomized to a comparison group or an intervention group that underwent a behavioral/nutritional modification program to decrease fat and increase vegetable, fruit, and grain intake for an average of 8.1 years. Ninety-three percent of participants completed the intervention, and 71% participated in active follow-up through 30 September 2015 (median 17.3 years). We measured time to development of treated diabetes and progression from oral antihyperglycemic agents to insulin. Serum glucose and insulin were measured in a subsample of women (N = 2,324) at baseline and years 1, 3, and 6. RESULTS During the trial, intervention group women had lower rates of initiation of insulin therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% CI 0.59, 0.94]; P = 0.01). Moreover, women with baseline waist circumference ≥88 cm (P interaction = 0.01) and worse metabolic syndrome scores (P interaction = 0.02) had the greatest reduction in risk of initiating insulin therapy. The decreased risk from the intervention was present during the cumulative follow-up (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.78, 0.99]; P = 0.04). In participants with measured biomarkers (5.8% subsample) who had baseline glucose <100 mg/dL, the intervention reduced the risk of developing glucose ≥100 mg/dL by 25% (odds ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.61, 0.93]; P = 0.008). Adjustment for weight change did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS In this secondary analysis, a dietary intervention in postmenopausal women aimed at reducing fat and increasing intake of vegetables, fruits, and grains did not increase risk of diabetes and may have slowed progression."

Paper Title
Anthropometric measures and serum estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women: the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study,

Year
2017,

Abstract
"Several anthropometric measures have been associated with hormone-related cancers. However, it is unknown whether estrogen metabolism plays an important role in these relationships. We examined whether measured current body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), height, and self-reported BMI at age 18 years were associated with serum estrogens/estrogen metabolites using baseline, cross-sectional data from 1835 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. Fifteen estrogens/estrogen metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Geometric means (GMs) of estrogens/estrogen metabolites (in picomoles per liter) were estimated using inverse probability weighted linear regression, adjusting for potential confounders and stratified on menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use. Among never or former MHT users, current BMI (≥30 vs. <25 kg/m2) was positively associated with parent estrogens (multivariable adjusted GM 432 vs. 239 pmol/L for estrone, 74 vs. 46 pmol/L for estradiol; p-trend < 0.001 for both) and all of the 2-, 4-, and 16-pathway estrogen metabolites evaluated (all p-trend ≤ 0.02). After additional adjustment for estradiol, unconjugated methylated 2-catechols were inversely associated (e.g., 2-methoxyestrone multivariable GM 9.3 vs. 12.0 pmol/L; p-trend < 0.001). Among current MHT users, current BMI was not associated with parent estrogens but was inversely associated with methylated catechols (e.g., 2-methoxyestrone multivariable GM 216 vs. 280 pmol/L; p-trend = 0.008). Similar patterns of association were found with WHR; however, the associations were not independent of BMI. Height and BMI at age 18 years were not associated with postmenopausal estrogens/estrogen metabolite levels. Our data suggest that postmenopausal BMI is associated with increased circulating levels of parent estrogens and reduced methylation of catechol estrogen metabolites, the estrogen metabolism patterns that have previously been associated with higher breast cancer risk."

Aging Well Among Women Veterans Compared With Non-Veterans in the Women's Health Initiative.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
To examine whether Veteran status influences (a) women's survival to age 80 years without disease and disability and (b) indicators of successful, effective, and optimal aging at ages 80 years and older.


DESIGN AND METHODS
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled 161,808 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years from 1993 to 1998. We compared successful aging indicators collected in 2011-2012 via mailed questionnaire among 33,565 women (921 Veterans) who reached the age of 80 years and older, according to Veteran status. A second analysis focused on women with intact mobility at baseline who could have reached age 80 years by December 2013. Multinominal logistic models examined Veteran status in relation to survival to age 80 years without major disease or mobility disability versus having prevalent or incident disease, having mobility disability, or dying prior to age 80 years.


RESULTS
Women Veterans aged 80 years and older reported significantly lower perceived health, physical function, life satisfaction, social support, quality of life, and purpose in life scale scores compared with non-Veterans. The largest difference was in physical function scores (53.0 for Veterans vs 59.5 for non-Veterans; p < .001). Women Veterans were significantly more likely to die prior to age 80 years than non-Veteran WHI participants (multivariate adjusted odds ratio = 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.38). In both Veteran and non-Veteran women, healthy survival was associated with not smoking, higher physical activity, healthy body weight, and fewer depressive symptoms.


IMPLICATIONS
Intervening upon smoking, low physical activity, obesity, and depressive symptoms has potential to improve chances for healthy survival in older women including Veterans."

Paper Title
Coffee and caffeine consumption and the risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
The associations of coffee and caffeine intakes with the risk of incident hypertension remain controversial.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to assess longitudinal relations of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and total caffeine intakes with mean blood pressure and incident hypertension in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.


DESIGN
In a large prospective study, type and amount of coffee and total caffeine intakes were assessed by using self-reported questionnaires. Hypertension status was ascertained by using measured blood pressure and self-reported drug-treated hypertension. The mean intakes of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine were 2-3 cups/d, 1 cup/d, and 196 mg/d, respectively. Using multivariable linear regression, we examined the associations of baseline intakes of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine with measured systolic and diastolic blood pressures at annual visit 3 in 29,985 postmenopausal women who were not hypertensive at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs and their 95% CIs for time to incident hypertension.


RESULTS
During 112,935 person-years of follow-up, 5566 cases of incident hypertension were reported. Neither caffeinated coffee nor caffeine intake was associated with mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure, but decaffeinated coffee intake was associated with a small but clinically irrelevant decrease in mean diastolic blood pressure. Decaffeinated coffee intake was not associated with mean systolic blood pressure. Intakes of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine were not associated with the risk of incident hypertension (P-trend > 0.05 for all).


CONCLUSION
In summary, these findings suggest that caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine are not risk factors for hypertension in postmenopausal women."

Paper Title
Association of Pain With Physical Function, Depressive Symptoms, Fatigue, and Sleep Quality Among Veteran and non-Veteran Postmenopausal Women.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"PURPOSE OF STUDY
To characterize the prevalence and longitudinal effects of pain in older Veteran and non-Veteran women.


DESIGN AND METHODS
Data on 144,956 participants in the Women's Health Initiative were analyzed. At baseline, Veteran status, pain severity, and pain interference with activity were assessed. Outcomes of physical function, depressive symptoms, fatigue, and sleep quality were reported at baseline by all study participants and longitudinally on two follow-up occasions (3 years and 13-18 years after baseline) in the observational study participants (n = 87,336).


RESULTS
At baseline, a total of 3,687 (2.5%) had a history of military service and 22,813 (15.8%) reported that pain limited their activity level moderately to extremely during the past 4 weeks. Prevalence of pain interference did not differ in Veterans and non-Veterans (16.8% and 15.7%, respectively; p= .09). At baseline, women with moderate-to-extreme pain interference had substantially worse physical function and greater symptoms of depression, fatigue, and insomnia than those with less pain (p < .001 for all comparisons), adjusting for several social, behavioral, and health related factors. There were no significant military service by pain interference interactions for any of the outcomes (p > .2), indicating that the effect of pain interference on outcomes at baseline did not vary between Veterans and non-Veterans. Moderate-to-extreme pain interference was associated with a greater rate of decline in physical function over time (p < .001) and higher incidence of limited physical functioning (p < .001), but these effects did not vary by Veteran status. Similar results were observed with pain severity as the exposure variable.


IMPLICATIONS
As the Veteran population ages and the number of women exposed to combat operations grows, there will be an increased need for health care services that address not only pain severity and interference but also other disabling comorbid symptoms."

Paper Title
Duration of Adulthood Overweight, Obesity, and Cancer Risk in the Women’s Health Initiative: A Longitudinal Study from the United States,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"Background High body mass index (BMI) has become the leading risk factor of disease burden in high-income countries. While recent studies have suggested that the risk of cancer related to obesity is mediated by time, insights into the dose-response relationship and the cumulative impact of overweight and obesity during the life course on cancer risk remain scarce. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity duration on the risk of cancer in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. Methods and Findings Participants from the observational study of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) with BMI information from at least three occasions during follow-up, free of cancer at baseline, and with complete covariate information were included (n = 73,913). Trajectories of BMI across ages were estimated using a quadratic growth model; overweight duration (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), obesity duration (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), and weighted cumulative overweight and obese years, which take into account the degree of overweight and obesity over time (a measure similar to pack-years of cigarette smoking), were calculated using predicted BMIs. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to determine the cancer risk associated with overweight and obesity duration. In secondary analyses, the influence of important effect modifiers and confounders, such as smoking status, postmenopausal hormone use, and ethnicity, was assessed. A longer duration of overweight was significantly associated with the incidence of all obesity-related cancers (hazard ratio [HR] per 10-y increment: 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.09). For postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer, every 10-y increase in adulthood overweight duration was associated with a 5% and 17% increase in risk, respectively. On adjusting for intensity of overweight, these figures rose to 8% and 37%, respectively. Risks of postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer related to overweight duration were much more pronounced in women who never used postmenopausal hormones. This study has limitations because some of the anthropometric information was obtained from retrospective self-reports. Furthermore, data from longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up and repeated anthropometric measures are typically subject to missing data at various time points, which was also the case in this study. Yet, this limitation was partially overcome by using growth curve models, which enabled us to impute data at missing time points for each participant. Conclusions In summary, this study showed that a longer duration of overweight and obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing several forms of cancer. Furthermore, the degree of overweight experienced during adulthood seemed to play an important role in the risk of developing cancer, especially for endometrial cancer. Although the observational nature of our study precludes inferring causality or making clinical recommendations, our findings suggest that reducing overweight duration in adulthood could reduce cancer risk and that obesity prevention is important from early onset. If this is true, health care teams should recognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient."

Abstract 13096: Mechanisms Underlying Associations Between Optimism, Hostility, and Cardiovascular Risk,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"
 Introduction:
 Optimism has been associated with reduced cardiovascular (CV) risk, while cynical hostility has been linked with worse CV risk. The pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying these associations are largely unexplored. We sought to examine associations between optimism, hostility, and heart rate variability (HRV).
 
 
 Hypothesis:
 Greater optimism will be associated with higher HRV, while greater hostility will be associated with lower HRV.
 
 
 Methods:
 Participants (n=3,372) enrolled in the Myocardial Ischemia and Migraine Study, a Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) ancillary study, underwent a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring (AECG) 3 years after WHI enrollment. Optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), cynical hostility (Cook-Medley questionnaire), demographics, and CV risk factors were assessed at baseline. HRV measures included standard deviation of all analyzed N-N intervals (SDNN); standard deviation of average N-N interval over 5 min (SDANN); and average heart rate (HR). Multivariable linear regression models examined the relationship between optimism, hostility and HRV indices adjusted for demographics and coronary risk factors.
 
 
 Results:
 After excluding women with previous CV disease, missing data, and AECG <12 hours, 2655 were included in the analysis. At baseline, more optimistic women were more likely to be younger, white, educated, non-smokers, physically active, and to have lower systolic blood pressure (SBP). More hostile women were more likely to be older, Hispanic or African American, less educated, diabetic, obese, smokers, and to have high cholesterol and high SBP. We found a significant inverse association between hostility and HRV (SDANN: adjusted β= -0.54; 95% CI -0.97, -0.11; SDNN: -0.49; 95% CI -0.93, -0.05). Optimism was not associated with HRV indices (SDANN: adjusted β= 0.10; 95% CI -0.25, 0.44; SDNN: 0.03; 95% CI -0.32, 0.39). Average HR was not associated with optimism or hostility.
 
 
 Conclusions:
 A worse autonomic balance may play a role in the physiopathology of unfavorable CV outcomes observed among women with higher cynical hostility. The lack of association between HRV and optimism suggests that other (behavioral?) factors may play a role in the protective association between optimism and CV outcomes.

Aging Well: Observations From the Women's Health Initiative Study.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
As the proportion of the population aged 80 and over accelerates, so does the value of understanding the processes of aging well. The purposes of this article are to: (a) review contemporary theoretical and conceptual perspectives on aging well, (b) describe indicators of aging well that reflect key concepts and perspectives as assessed in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and (c) characterize the status of aging among women aged 80 and older using data obtained from WHI participants at the WHI Extension 2 follow-up.


METHODS
Data from the Lifestyle Questionnaire, which was administered from 2011 to 2012 during the WHI Follow-up Study (Extension 2), were analyzed to provide a profile of the WHI cohort with respect to aging well.


RESULTS
Data revealed substantial diversity in the cohort with respect to the various measures of aging well. Although many reported physical functioning levels consistent with disability, most rated their health as good or better. Most reported moderately high levels of resilience, self-control, and self-mastery but lower levels of environmental mastery. Finally, the cohort reported high levels of optimal aging as reflected by their high levels of emotional well-being and moderately high levels of life satisfaction and social support, but more modest levels of personal growth and purpose in life.


CONCLUSIONS
The wide range of some dimensions of aging well suggest that further examination of predictors of positive coping and resilience in the face of aging-related disability could identify opportunities to support and facilitate aging well among U.S. women."

Paper Title
Glucose Levels and Risk of Frailty.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
The association between glucose levels and incident frailty in older persons remains unclear. We examined the extent to which higher glucose levels in older adults with and without diabetes are related to risk of frailty.


METHODS
The data are from the Adult Changes in Thought study. We identified 1,848 individuals aged 65+ without dementia for whom glucose levels from laboratory measurements of glucose and glycated hemoglobin were available. Physical frailty using modified Fried's criteria was determined from biennial assessments. Frailty hazard was modeled as a function of time-varying measures of diabetes and average glucose levels using Cox regression.


RESULTS
A total of 578 incident frailty cases (94 with diabetes, 484 without) occurred during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. The adjusted hazard ratio for frailty comparing those with and without diabetes was 1.52 (95% confidence interval = 1.19-1.94). In participants without diabetes, modeling suggested elevated frailty risk with greater average glucose levels (p = .019); for example, a glucose level of 110mg/dL compared with 100mg/dL yielded a hazard ratio of 1.32 (95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.59). In participants with diabetes, glucose levels less than 160mg/dL and greater than 180mg/dL were related to increased risk of frailty (p = .001).


CONCLUSION
Higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for frailty in older adults without diabetes. The apparent U-shape association between glucose levels and frailty in people with diabetes is consistent with the literature on glycemia and mortality and deserves further examination."

Paper Title
Predictors of Optimal Cognitive Aging in 80+ Women: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study.,

Year
2016,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
Independent predictors of preserved cognitive functioning and factors associated with maintaining high preserved cognitive function in women ≥ 80 years remain elusive.


METHODS
Two thousand two hundred twenty-eight women with a mean age of 85 years who participated in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study were classified as cognitively normal (n = 1,905, 85.5%), mild cognitive impairment (n = 88, 3.9%), dementia (n = 121, 5.4%) or other cognitive impairment (n = 114, n = 5.1%) by central adjudication. Global cognitive functioning was assessed using telephone interview for cognitive status-modified in those women who did not meet cognitive impairment criteria. Differences between women grouped by cognitive status with respect to each potential risk factor were assessed using chi-squared tests and t-tests. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to select factors that were independently associated with cognitive status.


RESULTS
Factors associated with preserved cognitive functioning were younger age, higher education, and family incomes, being non-Hispanic white, better emotional wellbeing, fewer depressive symptoms, more insomnia complaints, being free of diabetes, and not carrying the apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 allele. Cognitively normal women who demonstrated sustained high preserved cognition were younger, more educated, and endorsed better self-reported general health, emotional wellbeing, and higher physical functioning.


CONCLUSIONS
Addressing sociodemographic disparities such as income inequality, and targeting interventions to improve depressive symptoms and vascular risk factors, including diabetes, may play an important role in preserving cognition among women who survive to 80 years of age. Person-centered approaches that combine interventions to improve physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning may promote maintenance of high preserved cognitive health in the oldest-old."

Paper Title
Dispositional optimism and terminal decline in global quality of life.,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"We examined whether dispositional optimism relates to change in global quality of life (QOL) as a function of either chronological age or years to impending death. We used a sample of 2,096 deceased postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials who were enrolled in the 2005-2010 Extension Study and for whom at least 1 global QOL and optimism measure were analyzed. Growth curve models were examined. Competing models were contrasted using model fit criteria. On average, levels of global QOL decreased with both higher age and closer proximity to death (e.g., M(score) = 7.7 eight years prior to death vs. M(score) = 6.1 one year prior to death). A decline in global QOL was better modeled as a function of distance to death (DtD) than as a function of chronological age (Bayesian information criterion [BIC](DtD) = 22,964.8 vs. BIC(age) = 23,322.6). Optimism was a significant correlate of both linear (estimate(DtD) = -0.01, SE(DtD) = 0.005; ρ = 0.004) and quadratic (estimate(DtD) = -0.006, SE(DtD) = 0.002; ρ = 0.004) terminal decline in global QOL so that death-related decline in global QOL was steeper among those with a high level of optimism than those with a low level of optimism. We found that dispositional optimism helps to maintain positive psychological perspective in the face of age-related decline. Optimists maintain higher QOL compared with pessimists when death-related trajectories were considered; however, the gap between those with high optimism and those with low optimism progressively attenuated with closer proximity to death, to the point that is became nonsignificant at the time of death."

Paper Title
Global quality of life modifies terminal change in physical functioning among older adult women.,

Year
2015,

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
the factors that moderate decline in physical functioning as death approaches are understudied. This study aimed to assess death-related decline in global quality of life (QoL) and physical functioning and to test whether baseline QoL moderates terminal decline in physical functioning.


METHODS
four thousand six hundred and fifty-one decedents from the Women's Health Initiative Study (WHI) rated QoL and physical functioning each year throughout 5 years of follow-up.


RESULTS
both QoL and physical functioning showed a steeper decline as a function of years to death than as a function of chronological age. Moreover, decedents with higher QoL at baseline showed a less steep decline in physical functioning as death approached than those with lower QoL at baseline.


CONCLUSION
although QoL strongly decreases across the terminal years, its beneficial influence on physical functioning is evident till the very end of life."

Longitudinal Associations between Self-Rated Health and Performance-Based Physical Function in a Population-Based Cohort of Older Adults,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"Background Although self-rated health (SRH) and performance-based physical function (PPF) are both strong predictors of mortality, little research has investigated the relationships between them. The objective of this study was to evaluate longitudinal, bi-directional associations between SRH and PPF. Methods We evaluated longitudinal associations between SRH and PPF in 3,610 adults aged 65–89 followed for an average of 4.8 (standard deviation [SD]: 4.4) years between 1994 and July 2011 in the Adult Changes in Thought study, a population-based cohort in the Seattle area. SRH was assessed with a single-item question in the ACT study. Participants were asked at each evaluation to rate their health as “excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair”, or “poor” in response to the question “In general, how would you rate your health at this time”. PPF scores (ranging from 0–16, with higher indicating better performance) included walking speed, chair rises, grip strength, and balance. Results At the baseline visit, participants averaged 74.5 (SD: 5.8) years of age and 2,115 (58.6%) were female. In multivariable linear mixed models, PPF declined with age, with more rapid decreases associated with very good, good, and fair (vs. excellent) baseline SRH. Adjusted annual change in PPF was −0.17 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.19, −0.15) for individuals with excellent baseline SRH and −0.21 points (95% CI: −0.22, −0.19) for participants with fair SRH. In multivariable generalized linear mixed models, lower baseline PPF quartiles were associated with lower odds of excellent/very good/good SRH at age 75, however, differences between baseline PPF quartiles diminished with age. Conclusions These results suggest that less than excellent SRH predicts decline in physical functioning, however, poor physical functioning may not predict change in SRH in a reciprocal fashion. SRH provides a simple assessment tool for identifying individuals at increased risk for decline in physical function."

Abstract
"BACKGROUND
To develop a positive aging phenotype, we undertook analyses to describe multiple dimensions of positive aging and their relationships to one another in women 65 years of age and older and evaluate the performance of individual indicators and composite factors of this phenotype as predictors of time to death, years of healthy living, and years of independent living.


METHODS
Data from Women's Health Initiative clinical trial and observational study participants ages 65 years and older at baseline, including follow-up observations up to 8 years later, were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal components analysis to identify the factor structure of a positive aging phenotype. The factors were used to predict time to death, years of healthy living (without hospitalization or diagnosis of a serious health condition), and years of independent living (without nursing home admission or use of special services).


RESULTS
We identified a multidimensional phenotype of positive aging that included two factors: Physical-Social Functioning and Emotional Functioning. Both factors were predictive of each of the outcomes, but Physical-Social Functioning was the strongest predictor. Each standard deviation of increase in Physical-Social Functioning was accompanied by a 23.7% reduction in mortality risk, a 19.4% reduction in risk of major health conditions or hospitalizations, and a 26.3% reduction in risk of dependent living.


CONCLUSIONS
Physical-Social Functioning and Emotional Functioning constitute important components of a positive aging phenotype. Physical-Social Functioning was the strongest predictor of outcomes related to positive aging, including years of healthy living, years of independent living, and time to mortality."

Paper Title
The role of emerging information technologies in frailty assessment.,

Year
2012,

Abstract
"Frailty has an insidious impact on multiple systems, resulting in increased disability, morbidity, and mortality among community-dwelling older adults. Notwithstanding the burden that frailty imposes on individuals, there is still a lack of consensus on its operational and conceptual definitions, leading research groups to invest efforts into developing a more comprehensive model of frailty. A number of screening models have been proposed to objectively measure the magnitude of the frailty process and to assess its long-term consequences. Each model incorporates a distinct set of physiological parameters stemming from the combination of a number of clinical domains. Emerging information technologies (ITs) could provide an effective, flexible, and integrative solution for monitoring and measuring the different aspects of the frailty construct in real-life settings. The purpose of this article is to discuss how various ITs can be used to measure the core characteristics of frailty identified from an integrative systematic review. We discuss the actual and potential integration of ITs in frailty research, strengths and limitations of various methods, and areas for future work."

Paper Title
A Holistic approach to assess older adults' wellness using e-health technologies.,

Year
2011,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVES
To date, methodologies are lacking that address a holistic assessment of wellness in older adults. Technology applications may provide a platform for such an assessment, but have not been validated. We set out to demonstrate whether e-health applications could support the assessment of older adults' wellness in community-dwelling older adults.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-seven residents of independent retirement community were followed over 8 weeks. Subjects engaged in the use of diverse technologies to assess cognitive performance, physiological and functional variables, as well as psychometric components of wellness. Data were integrated from various e-health sources into one study database. Correlations were assessed between different parameters, and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to explore the validity of the wellness model.


RESULTS
We found strong associations across multiple parameters of wellness within the conceptual model, including cognitive, functional, and physical. However, spirituality did not correlate with any other parameter studied in contrast to prior studies of older adults. Participants expressed overall positive attitudes toward the e-health tools and the holistic approach to the assessment of wellness, without expressing any privacy concerns.


CONCLUSIONS
Parameters were highly correlated across multiple domains of wellness. Important clusters were noted to be formed across cognitive and physiological domains, giving further evidence of need for an integrated approach to the assessment of wellness. This finding warrants further replication in larger and more diverse samples of older adults to standardize and deploy these technologies across population groups."

Paper Title
Development and Usability Testing of a System to Detect Adverse Events and Medical Mistakes,

Year
2022,

Abstract
"Many inpatient hospital visits result in adverse events, and a disproportionate number of adverse events are thought to occur among vulnerable populations. The personal and financial costs of these events are significant at the individual, care team, and system levels. Existing methods for identifying adverse events, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Global Trigger Tool, typically involve retroactive chart review to identify risks or triggers and then detailed review to determine whether and what type of harm occurred. These methods are limited in scalability and ability to prospectively identify triggers to enable intervention before an adverse event occurs. The purpose of this study was to gather usability feedback on a prototype of an informatics intervention based on the IHI method. The prototype electronic Global Trigger Tool collects and presents risk factors for adverse events. Six health professionals identified as potential users in clinical, quality improvement, and research roles were interviewed. Interviewees universally described insufficiencies of current methods for tracking adverse events and offered important information on desired future user interface features. A key next step will be to refine and integrate an electronic Global Trigger Tool system into standards-compliant electronic health record systems as a patient safety module."

An Exploratory Mixed Methods Study of Experiences of Interprofessional Teams Who Received Coaching to Simultaneously Redesign Primary Care Education and Clinical Practice,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Introduction/Objectives: Coaching is emerging as a form of facilitation in health professions education. Most studies focus on one-on-one coaching rather than team coaching. We assessed the experiences of interprofessional teams coached to simultaneously improve primary care residency training and interprofessional practice. Methods: This three-year exploratory mixed methods study included transformational assistance from 9 interprofessional coaches, one assigned to each of 9 interprofessional primary care teams that included family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, nursing, pharmacy and behavioral health. Coaches interacted with teams during 2 in-person training sessions, an in-person site visit, and then as requested by their teams. Surveys administered at 1 year and end study assessed the coaching relationship and process. Results: The majority of participants (82% at end of Year 1 and 76.6% at end study) agreed or strongly agreed that their coach developed a positive working relationship with their team. Participants indicated coaches helped them: (1) develop as teams, (2) stay on task, and (3) respond to local context issues, with between 54.3% and 69.2% agreeing or strongly agreeing that their coaches were helpful in these areas. Cronbach’s alpha for the 15 coaching survey items was 0.965. Challenges included aligning the coach’s expertise with the team’s needs. Conclusions: While team coaching was well received by interprofessional teams of primary care professionals undertaking educational and clinical redesign, the 3 primary care disciplines have much to learn from each other regarding how to improve inter- and intra-professional collaborative practice among clinicians and staff as well as with interprofessional learners rotating through their outpatient clinics."

16506 Recognizing Interdisciplinary Collaborative Research in Promotion and Tenure Processes,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT IMPACT: Recognizing Interdisciplinary Collaborative Research in Promotion and Tenure Processes OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Academic institutions have traditionally focused on individual achievements for promotion. We present our effort on identifying and measuring attitudes on promotion and tenure (PT) criteria that values and rewards interdisciplinary research (IR). We have developed a toolkit to facilitate the recognition of IR in PT processes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Our group reviewed appointment, promotion and tenure (APT) policies from each of the six Health Science Schools and the College of Engineering at the University of Washington (UW) to assess language of objective criteria and attributes of IR to guide APT committees in the evaluation of interdisciplinary researchers. We surveyed faculty about their attitudes relating to IR within the context of promotion and tenure. Interviews of department chairs and administrators about institutional policies and infrastructure that supports or inhibits IR, and current best practices, were conducted. We have developed toolkits for junior faculty, department chairs, external reviewers, and APT committees to facilitate rewarding IR at promotion. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Review of APT policies found criteria that recognizes IR for APT in three schools. 118 faculty responded to the survey (44% Professor, 26% Associate, and 37% eligible for APT committees). The majority of faculty reported they were currently conducting IR (95%), considered IR important (98%), and believed the UW faculty code should encourage IR (85%). Although a vast majority considered their units supportive of IR (>80%), less than half (43%) reported that their APT criteria provided examples that included participation in IR. Our survey also found that APT committees were challenged about best practices to reward IR, APT external reviewers struggle to evaluate individual vs team contributions, and individual faculty are challenged to describe contributions for APT within context of an interdisciplinary team. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: IR is conducted and valued by UW faculty; however, current structures, policies, and APT code do not facilitate IR for promotion and tenure. We have developed a toolkit for promotion-eligible faculty, chairs, external reviewers, and APT committees to facilitate IR. Our goal is to modify UW faculty code and unit APT criteria to recognize and reward IR."

Paper Title
A scoping review of new implementations of interprofessional bedside rounding models to improve teamwork, care, and outcomes in hospitals,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT Poor communication within healthcare teams occurs commonly, contributing to inefficiency, medical errors, conflict, and other adverse outcomes. Interprofessional bedside rounds (IBR) are a promising model that brings two or more health professions together with patients and families as part of a consistent, team-based routine to share information and collaboratively arrive at a daily plan of care. The purpose of this systematic scoping review was to investigate the breadth and quality of IBR literature to identify and describe gaps and opportunities for future research. We followed an adapted Arksey and O’Malley Framework and PRISMA scoping review guidelines. PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were systematically searched for key IBR words and concepts through June 2020. Seventy-nine articles met inclusion criteria and underwent data abstraction. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Publications in this field have increased since 2014, and the majority of studies reported positive impacts of IBR implementation across an array of team, patient, and care quality/delivery outcomes. Despite the preponderance of positive findings, great heterogeneity, and a reliance on quantitative non-randomized study designs remain in the extant research. A growing number of interventions to improve safety, quality, and care experiences in hospital settings focus on redesigning daily inpatient rounds. Limited information on IBR characteristics and implementation strategies coupled with widespread variation in terminology, study quality, and design create challenges in assessing the effectiveness of models of rounds and optimal implementation strategies. This scoping review highlights the need for additional studies of rounding models, implementation strategies, and outcomes that facilitate comparative research."

Implementation and evaluation of team science training for interdisciplinary teams in an engineering design program,

Year
2021,

Abstract
"Abstract Introduction: Interdisciplinary academic teams perform better when competent in teamwork; however, there is a lack of best practices of how to introduce and facilitate the development of effective learning and functioning within these teams in academic environments. Methods: To close this gap, we tailored, implemented, and evaluated team science training in the year-long Engineering Innovation in Health (EIH) program at the University of Washington (UW), a project-based course in which engineering students across several disciplines partner with health professionals to develop technical solutions to clinical and translational health challenges. EIH faculty from the UW College of Engineering and the Institute of Translational Health Sciences’ (ITHS) Team Science Core codeveloped and delivered team science training sessions and evaluated their impact with biannual surveys. A student cohort was surveyed prior to the implementation of the team science trainings, which served as a baseline. Results: Survey responses were compared within and between both cohorts (approximately 55 students each Fall Quarter and 30 students each Spring Quarter). Statistically significant improvements in measures of self-efficacy and interpersonal team climate (i.e., psychological safety) were observed within and between teams. Conclusions: Tailored team science training provided to student-professional teams resulted in measurable improvements in self-efficacy and interpersonal climate both of which are crucial for teamwork and intellectual risk taking. Future research is needed to determine long-term impacts of course participation on individual and team outcomes (e.g., patents, start-ups). Additionally, adaptability of this model to clinical and translational research teams in alternate formats and settings should be tested."

Year
2021,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT IMPACT: This project successfully implemented a promising team science model by introducing and facilitating best practices to develop high functioning teams working to accelerate health innovations from bench to bedside. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The goal of this project was to improve the team science knowledge, skills, and attitudes of interdisciplinary engineering students (undergraduate and graduate) who were partnered with health professionals to develop technical solutions to translational health challenges during a year-long Engineering Innovation in Health (EIH) program. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We adapted, implemented, and evaluated team science training content and approaches in the EIH program at the University of Washington (UW). EIH faculty and the UW Institute of Translational Health Sciences’ (ITHS) Team Science Core co-developed and delivered highly interactive team science training modules and evaluated their impact with biannual surveys. A student cohort was surveyed prior to the implementation of the team science trainings, which served as a baseline. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize student demographics and survey responses within and between years. Median and interquartile range of responses to Likert-type questions were calculated, and Mann-Whitney U Tests (independent samples Wilcoxin Rank Sum Tests) were used to test for differences within and between years. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: During both the baseline and the team training year, student demographics were similar in terms of gender and past experience working in teams. Team training during the first year of implementation was well-received. Post-implementation surveys of students demonstrated measurable improvement in team dynamics, communication, and effectiveness; including, students reporting higher levels of psychological safety and self-efficacy within their teams. Comparisons within the team training year and between the baseline and team training years identified numerous instances in which differences were statistically significant. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Tailored team science training in an interdisciplinary EIH program was successful at improving psychological safety and self-efficacy among undergraduate and graduate students and offers a promising model for similar settings and audiences."

Sustaining improvements in relational coordination following team training and practice change: A longitudinal analysis,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"Supplemental digital content is available in the text. Background Poor communication is a leading cause of errors in health care. Structured interprofessional bedside rounds are a promising model to improve communication. Purpose The aim of the study was to test if an intervention to improve communication and coordination in an inpatient heart failure care unit would result in lasting change. Methodology/Approach The relational coordination (RC) survey was administered to seven workgroups (i.e., nurses, physicians) at baseline (2015) and three subsequent years following the intervention (team training, leadership development workshops, and structured interprofessional bedside round implementation). Descriptive analysis and mixed-effects models were used to assess the impact of the intervention on improving RC. Results During the study period (2015–2018), 344 participants completed the survey for an overall response rate of 53.5% (n = 643). Postintervention, the RC index significantly increased from 3.79 to 4.08 (p < .001) and remained significantly higher over 2 years, with an RC index of 4.12 and 4.04, respectively (p < .001). The range of RC scores between and within workgroups narrowed over time, with nonrotating workgroups showing the most improvements. Conclusion Findings indicate that positive changes as a result of the intervention have been sustained, despite high rates of turnover among all workgroups. Notably, positive change in RC was found to be more pronounced for nonrotating workgroups compared to team members who rotate within the hospital (i.e., pharmacists who rotate to other units every month). Practice Implications This intervention holds promise for teams seeking best practice models of “high-reliability” care organization and delivery. Sustained changes from this intervention represent an important area of future practice-based research."

The effect of women, infant, and children (WIC) services on birth weight before and during the 2007–2009 great recession in Washington state and Florida: a pooled cross-sectional time series analysis,

Year
2020,

Abstract
"Background The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been shown to have positive effects in promoting healthy birth outcomes in the United States. We explored whether such effects held prior to and during the most recent Great Recession to improve birth outcomes and reduce differences among key socio-demographic groups. Methods We used a pooled cross-sectional time series design to study pregnant women and their infants with birth certificate data. We included Medicaid and uninsured births from Washington State and Florida ( n  = 226,835) before (01/2005–03/2007) and during (12/2007–06/2009) the Great Recession. Interactions between WIC enrollment and key socio-demographic groupings were analyzed for binary and continuous birth weight outcomes. Results Our study found beneficial WIC interaction effects on birth weight. For race, prenatal care, and maternal age we found significantly better birth weight outcomes in the presence of WIC compared to those without WIC. For example, being Black with WIC was associated with an increase in infant birth weight of 53.5 g (baseline) (95% CI = 32.4, 74.5) and 58.0 g (recession) (95% CI = 27.8, 88.3). For most groups this beneficial relationship was stable over time. Conclusions This paper supports previous research linking maternal utilization of WIC services during pregnancy to improved birth weight (both reducing LBW and increasing infant birth weight in grams) among some high-disadvantage groups. WIC appears to have been beneficial at decreasing disparity gaps in infant birth weight among the very young, Black, and late/no prenatal care enrollees in this high-need population, both before and during the Great Recession. Gaps are still present among other social and demographic characteristic groups (e.g., for unmarried mothers) for whom we did not find WIC to be associated with any detectable value in promoting better birth weight outcomes. Future research needs to examine how WIC (and/or other maternal and child health programs) could be made to work better and reach farther to address persistent disparities in birth weight outcomes. Additionally, in preparation for future economic downturns it will be important to determine how to preserve and, if possible, expand WIC services during times of increased need. Trial registration Not applicable, this article reports only on secondary retrospective data (no health interventions with human participants were carried out)."

Distance to HIV and Antenatal Care: A Geospatial Analysis in Siaya County, Kenya.,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"As maternal child health (MCH) programs expand in the setting of HIV, health systems are challenged to reach those most vulnerable and at the greatest need. Cross-sectional surveys of MCH clinics and recent mothers in the Siaya Health Demographic Surveillance System were conducted to assess correlates of accessing antenatal care and facility delivery. Of 376 recent mothers, 93.4% accessed antenatal care and 41.2% accessed facility delivery. Per-kilometer distance between maternal residence and the nearest facility offering delivery services was associated with 7% decreased probability of uptake of facility delivery. Compared with a reference of less than 1 km between home and clinic, a distance of more than 3 km to the nearest facility was associated with 25% decreased probability of uptake of facility delivery. Distance to care was a factor in accessing facility delivery services. Decentralization or transportation considerations may be useful to optimize MCH and HIV service impact in high-prevalence regions."

Competencies for improving diagnosis: an interprofessional framework for education and training in health care,

Year
2019,

Abstract
"Abstract Background Given an unacceptably high incidence of diagnostic errors, we sought to identify the key competencies that should be considered for inclusion in health professions education programs to improve the quality and safety of diagnosis in clinical practice. Methods An interprofessional group reviewed existing competency expectations for multiple health professions, and conducted a search that explored quality, safety, and competency in diagnosis. An iterative series of group discussions and concept prioritization was used to derive a final set of competencies. Results Twelve competencies were identified: Six of these are individual competencies: The first four (#1–#4) focus on acquiring the key information needed for diagnosis and formulating an appropriate, prioritized differential diagnosis; individual competency #5 is taking advantage of second opinions, decision support, and checklists; and #6 is using reflection and critical thinking to improve diagnostic performance. Three competencies focus on teamwork: Involving the patient and family (#1) and all relevant health professionals (#2) in the diagnostic process; and (#3) ensuring safe transitions of care and handoffs, and “closing the loop” on test result communication. The final three competencies emphasize system-related aspects of care: (#1) Understanding how human-factor elements influence the diagnostic process; (#2) developing a supportive culture; and (#3) reporting and disclosing diagnostic errors that are recognized, and learning from both successful diagnosis and from diagnostic errors. Conclusions These newly defined competencies are relevant to all health professions education programs and should be incorporated into educational programs."

Clinical nurses’ experiences and perceptions after the implementation of an interprofessional team intervention: A qualitative study,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To explore clinical nurses' experiences and perceptions following a purposeful interprofessional (IP) team intervention in practice.


BACKGROUND
Despite increasing interest in IP collaborative practice to improve teamwork, nursing outcomes and quality of care, there has been little research that focused on nurses' perspectives of IP collaboration after a purposeful IP team intervention.


DESIGN
A qualitative descriptive study using focus group interviews of registered nurses who care for patients with advanced heart failure.


METHODS
This study is part of a larger study that conducted and evaluated a purposeful IP team intervention. Registered nurses (n = 10) were invited to participate in three focus groups following the IP team intervention. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using a conventional content analysis approach and constant comparative method.


RESULTS
We identified six interrelated themes: (a) IP team building, (b) psychological safety and cultural change, (c) efficiency in delivery of care, (d) quality of patient care, (e) job outcomes and (f) team challenges. Notably, participants reported that they could better understand the patient's care plan of the day because every team member was "on the same page at the same time." Registered nurses perceived that they were more satisfied with their job through improved IP team performance, enhanced psychological safety and cultural change, efficient workflow and better quality of patient care.


CONCLUSIONS
The IP team intervention contributed to enhancing IP team functioning as well as improving registered nurse job satisfaction. To sustain the improved perceptional and behavioural changes, team strategies to improve workflow and communication should be considered.


RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE
Effective teamwork and communication between multiple healthcare professionals including nurses are the cornerstones to improve care delivery, nursing outcomes and quality of patient care in clinical settings."

Purposeful interprofessional team intervention improves relational coordination among advanced heart failure care teams,

Year
2018,

Abstract
"ABSTRACT Effective delivery of healthcare is highly interdependent within and between interprofessional (IP) care teams and the patients they serve. This is particularly true for complex health conditions such as advanced heart failure (AHF). Our Academic Practice Partnership received funding to carry out IP workforce development with inpatient AHF care teams. Our objectives were to (a) identify challenges in team functioning that affected communication and relationships among the AHF care teams, (b) collaboratively identify a focal work process in need of improvement, and (c) test whether facilitated the implementation of team training and work process changes would lead to improvements in team communication, relationships, and process outcomes. The health-care team identified implementation of structured IP bedside rounds (SIBR) as the preferred approach to improving collaborative care. Utilizing a cross-sectional pre/post design, changes in team communication and relationships before and after a team intervention that included TeamSTEPPS training and SIBR implementation, were assessed using a validated Relational Coordination (RC) survey. The study population included AHF care team members (n ~ 100) representing seven workgroups (e.g., nurses, pharmacists) from two inpatient cardiology units at a 450-bed academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest during 2015–2016. Improvements in RC scores were demonstrated across all seven RC dimensions from baseline (Year 1) to follow-up (Year 2). Percent change on each of the seven dimensions ranged from 3.57% to 9.85%. Changes were statistically significant for improvements between baseline and follow-up on all but one of the seven RC dimensions (shared knowledge). The IP team intervention was associated with improvements in RC from baseline to follow-up. Additional research is needed to assess patient perspectives and outcomes of the IP team intervention. Findings of this study are consistent with the growing body of RC and SIBR research and provide a useful model of an IP team-based intervention in clinical practice."

The prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV cascade analysis tool: supporting health managers to improve facility-level service delivery,

Year
2014,

Abstract
"The objective of the prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (pMTCT) cascade analysis tool is to provide frontline health managers at the facility level with the means to rapidly, independently and quantitatively track patient flows through the pMTCT cascade, and readily identify priority areas for clinic-level improvement interventions. Over a period of six months, five experienced maternal-child health managers and researchers iteratively adapted and tested this systems analysis tool for pMTCT services. They prioritized components of the pMTCT cascade for inclusion, disseminated multiple versions to 27 health managers and piloted it in five facilities. Process mapping techniques were used to chart PMTCT cascade steps in these five facilities, to document antenatal care attendance, HIV testing and counseling, provision of prophylactic anti-retrovirals, safe delivery, safe infant feeding, infant follow-up including HIV testing, and family planning, in order to obtain site-specific knowledge of service delivery. Seven pMTCT cascade steps were included in the Excel-based final tool. Prevalence calculations were incorporated as sub-headings under relevant steps. Cells not requiring data inputs were locked, wording was simplified and stepwise drop-offs and maximization functions were included at key steps along the cascade. While the drop off function allows health workers to rapidly assess how many patients were lost at each step, the maximization function details the additional people served if only one step improves to 100% capacity while others stay constant. Our experience suggests that adaptation of a cascade analysis tool for facility-level pMTCT services is feasible and appropriate as a starting point for discussions of where to implement improvement strategies. The resulting tool facilitates the engagement of frontline health workers and managers who fill out, interpret, apply the tool, and then follow up with quality improvement activities. Research on adoption, interpretation, and sustainability of this pMTCT cascade analysis tool by frontline health managers is needed. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02023658, December 9, 2013"

The Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes of Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis,

Year
2012,

Abstract
"The prevalence of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) has shown a dramatic increase with the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) for patient care. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with UEDVT at an academic medical center over a 1-year period. Medical records of 373 consecutive patients who underwent upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound (VDU) examination were retrospectively reviewed. A quarter of the patients screened by VDU (94 of 373) had acute UEDVT; 63% presented with arm swelling or arm pain; 48% had cancer; and 93% had indwelling CVCs. Cancer patients with CVCs were more likely to develop UEDVT (48%). Of the 94 UEDVTs, 16% had concurrent lower extremity DVT. The incidence of objectively confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) was 9% (8 of 94 patients), and the 1-month mortality rate was 6.4%. The majority of patients (80%) with UEDVT received anticoagulation therapy and 20% were not treated. The most common risk factors for UEDVT were indwelling CVCs and a diagnosis of cancer. The incidence rate of PE and mortality rate from UEDVT were not insignificant at 9% and 6%, respectively. There were no institutional screening protocols for patients at risk of UEDVT associated with CVCs. Future research should focus on risk assessment and management protocols for patients at risk of UEDVT. In addition, a comparison of clinical outcomes associated with the type, size, and duration of catheter placement should be conducted in patients at risk of or diagnosed with UEDVT."

Cost-Effective Diagnostic Strategies in Patients With a High, Intermediate, or Low Clinical Probability of Pulmonary Embolism,

Year
2011,

Abstract
"Rapid quantitative D-dimer assays (DD), lower extremity venous duplex ultrasonography (US), and multislice computed tomographic (CT) angiography have been shown to have adequate sensitivities and specificities for diagnostic purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with a high, intermediate, or low clinical probability of PE. A formal cost-effectiveness analysis for the diagnosis of PE was performed. The main outcome measure for effectiveness was 3-month expected survival. The strategy of DD followed by CT was cost-effective and had the lowest cost per life saved for all patients suspected with PE. The conventional strategy including ventilation and perfusion lung scanning followed by pulmonary angiography (PA) or CT was not cost-effective. The leg US after CT was not also cost-effective. In clinical practice, the individual patient’s condition should be considered when choosing appropriate diagnostic tests."

Paper Title
Relationship between the length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery and ambulatory ability or mortality after discharge in Japan.,

Year
2010,

Abstract
"AIM
To examine whether the length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery is related to patients' ambulatory ability or mortality after discharge.


METHODS
This is a retrospective observational study of patients who had undergone hip fracture surgery at one of three hospitals in Japan. The medical records of patients who were > or =65 years and who had hip fracture surgery within the past 2.5 years were reviewed regarding the demographics, treatments, and health outcomes during the hospital stay. A mail survey, asking about health outcomes after discharge, was sent to the study participants and/or their family members. The response rate of the survey was 70% (n = 149).


RESULTS
The patients who were discharged between 30 and 39 days after surgery had significantly lower current ambulatory ability, compared to the patients who stayed for > or =40 days, after adjusting for patient characteristics, treatments, and hospital. The patients who were discharged within 2 weeks after surgery and the patients who were discharged between 30 and 39 days after surgery had a significantly higher risk of mortality, compared to the patients who stayed in the hospital for > or =40 days, after adjustments were made.


CONCLUSIONS
If patients are discharged to a rehabilitation hospital before they are totally recovered from surgery, the emphasis might be on their rehabilitation without adequate management of their comorbidities. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine the effects of a shorter length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery on patient outcomes."

Paper Title
Determinants of ambulatory ability after hip fracture surgery in Japan and the USA.,

Year
2010,

Abstract
"We examined the relationship of the length of stay and the day of initiating partial weight bearing to patients' level of ambulatory ability at 3 months after hip fracture surgery in Japan and the USA. The participants were patients aged > or = 65 years who had undergone hip fracture surgery between August 2005 and September 2007. The data were collected from three hospitals in Japan and two hospitals in the USA. The participants received questionnaires pertaining to patient health outcomes after discharge. One-hundred-and-forty-nine patients in Japan and 88 patients in the USA completed the questionnaire. In Japan, the length of stay before surgery was longer and partial weight bearing after surgery was initiated later, compared to the USA. This independently predicted a lower level of ambulatory ability at 3 months after surgery. Assessing the reasons for delaying surgery and partial weight bearing is important in Japan. Encouraging ambulation with weight bearing at the earliest possible time is essential for patients to maintain their ambulatory ability after hip fracture surgery. Prospective studies using a large sample and/or intervention studies are required to determine the causal effect on ambulatory ability."

Paper Title
Prevention and clinical outcomes in older inpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism.,

Year
2010,

Abstract
"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common preventable disorders among hospital inpatients. Advancing age is a major risk factor for VTE. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare prevention practices and clinical outcomes in older (age 65 and older) versus younger (ages 18 to 64) hospitalized patients at risk for or diagnosed with VTE. Medical charts of 210 older and 450 younger inpatients undergoing diagnostic tests to rule out VTE were reviewed at an academic medical center. Acute VTE was diagnosed in 17.1% of older and 22.7% of younger inpatients. Pharmacological prophylaxis was used in 70% of eligible older and 57% of eligible younger inpatients. Nearly one quarter of eligible older inpatients did not receive any VTE prevention measures. The 3-month mortality was higher in older inpatients (13.9%) compared with younger inpatients (9.8%) with VTE, despite the lower rate of VTE in older inpatients. Prevention measures for VTE were underused in both older and younger inpatients."

Paper Title
Coagulation, fibrinolysis, and recanalization after acute deep venous thrombosis.,

Year
2002,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
Recanalization is common after acute deep venous thrombosis, but the factors that contribute to its variable extent are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between recanalization and plasma markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis.


METHODS
Subjects with an ultrasound-confirmed deep venous thrombosis had prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity, and t-PA antigen levels determined before anticoagulation therapy. Ultrasound and plasma studies were repeated at 14 days, 1 month, and every 3 months for 1 year.


RESULTS
Among 71 enrolled subjects, F 1+2 levels normalized within 14 days. The mean t-PA activity was within the normal range at all follow-up intervals. However, the mean t-PA antigen (10.7 plus minus 10.5 to 13.6 plus minus 13.5 ng/mL; P =.04) and PAI-1 (9.0 plus minus 8.1 to 13.2 plus minus 17.3 U/mL; P =.05) levels increased between the time of presentation and day 14. The mean reduction in thrombus score among 44 patients who completed 9 months of follow-up was 60.9% (plus minus 42.1%). Percent recanalization was directly associated with initial t-PA activity levels (R =.4; P =.006) and inversely related to F 1+2 (R = minus sign. 5; P =.004), t-PA antigen (R = minus sign.5, P =.002), and PAI-1 (r = minus sign. 5, P =.001) levels. However, only initial F 1+2 (P =.0009) and t-PA antigen (P =.004) levels were independent predictors of the degree of recanalization.


CONCLUSION
Although the mechanisms by which the venous lumen is restored are still being elucidated, recanalization is inversely related to levels of activated coagulation (F 1+2) and fibrinolytic inhibition (t-PA antigen) at the time of presentation."

Paper Title
Markers of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis after acute deep venous thrombosis.,

Year
2000,

Abstract
"OBJECTIVE
Plasma markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis have proved sensitive in the initial diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The purpose of this study was to examine the evolution and utility of measuring D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F 1+2) levels after an acute DVT.


METHODS
Subjects with DVT confirmed by ultrasonography had quantitative plasma D-dimer and F 1+2 levels determined before anticoagulation. Ultrasound scan and coagulation studies were repeated at 3, 7, and 14 days; 1 month; and every 3 months for 1 year.


RESULTS
Sixty-one patients with a median initial thrombus score of 3 (interquartile range, 2-7) were followed up for 266 days (interquartile range, 91.5-364 days). Initial D-dimer levels were elevated in 92.7% of patients and were associated with thrombus extent (P =.003), whereas F 1+2 levels were increased in 94.5% of patients and were lower in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis (P =.001). Initial D-dimer (P =.002) and F 1+2 levels (P =.009) were significantly higher in the 26 (43%) patients with recurrent thrombosis during follow-up. Initial D-dimer levels of 2000 ng/mL or greater were predictive of recurrent events after both proximal and isolated calf vein thrombosis. Although interval increases in these markers had little value in detecting recurrent thrombotic events, D-dimer levels of 1000 ng/mL or greater and 500 ng/mL or greater had respective sensitivities of 89.3% and 100% in detecting early and late recurrences. Corresponding specificities were 35.6% and 53.9%.


CONCLUSIONS
Initial D-dimer levels are determined by total thrombus load and remain elevated long after an acute DVT. F 1+2 levels are less sensitive to thrombus score and return to baseline more quickly. Initial levels of these markers may have some utility in predicting the risk of ultrasound scan-documented recurrences, whereas increased D-dimer levels are a sensitive but nonspecific marker of these events."
